# Implementation: Complete OrderBusiness Entity with All Required Fields

## Task Description
Complete the OrderBusiness entity with all required fields as specified in the implementation task list.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created OrderPriority Enum
Created a new enum `OrderPriority` to represent the priority levels for orders:
- `LOW`: Low priority order. These orders can be processed when there are no higher priority orders.
- `NORMAL`: Normal priority order. This is the default priority for most orders.
- `HIGH`: High priority order. These orders should be processed before normal and low priority orders.
- `URGENT`: Urgent priority order. These orders require immediate attention and should be processed as soon as possible.

### 2. Enhanced OrderBusiness Class
Added the following fields to the OrderBusiness class:
- `priority`: The priority of the order (default: NORMAL)
- `dueDate`: The date by which the order must be completed
- `comments`: Additional notes or comments about the order
- `completedAt`: The timestamp when the order was completed

### 3. Added Getters and Setters
Implemented getters and setters for the new fields:
- `getPriority()` / `setPriority(OrderPriority priority)`
- `getDueDate()` / `setDueDate(LocalDate dueDate)`
- `getComments()` / `setComments(String comments)`
- `getCompletedAt()` (read-only)

### 4. Updated Order Completion Logic
Enhanced the `completeProcessing()` method to set the `completedAt` timestamp when an order is completed:
```java
public void completeProcessing() {
    if (status != OrderStatus.IN_PROGRESS) {
        throw new IllegalStateException("Cannot complete an order with status: " + status);
    }
    status = OrderStatus.COMPLETED;
    this.completedAt = new Timestamp(Instant.now());
    updateLastModifiedAt();
}
```

## Benefits
This implementation provides several benefits:
1. **Improved Order Management**: The priority field allows for better prioritization of orders
2. **Better Planning**: The due date field helps with scheduling and planning
3. **Enhanced Communication**: The comments field allows for additional notes and communication about the order
4. **Improved Tracking**: The completedAt timestamp provides a record of when the order was completed
5. **Better Reporting**: The additional fields enable more detailed reporting and analytics

## Relation to Requirements
This implementation satisfies the first task in the Order Management section of the implementation task list:
> Complete OrderBusiness entity with all required fields

The implementation provides a complete solution for managing orders with all the necessary fields, which is essential for the order management functionality in the BelSign system.
