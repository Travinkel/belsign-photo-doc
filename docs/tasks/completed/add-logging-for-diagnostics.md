# Enhanced Logging for Diagnostics

## Task Description
Add logging to relevant files to ascertain what is causing issues with Gluon's internal classes initialization and SQLite database configuration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Logging in SqliteDatabaseConfig.java
- Added detailed logging about the JDBC URL being used
- Added logging to check and list all migration files
- Added more detailed logging around the Flyway configuration and cleaning process
- Added logging to track the progress of migrations
- Improved exception logging for better error diagnosis

### 2. Enhanced Logging in StorageTypeManager.java
- Added logging about the storage type being initialized
- Added detailed logging for each storage type case
- Added try-catch blocks to catch and log exceptions during initialization
- Added code to test the database connection and check if tables exist
- Added logging about the state of the DataSource after initialization

### 3. Enhanced Logging in StorageTypeConfig.java
- Added detailed logging about the initialization process
- Added specific logging for each source of the storage type (environment variable, system property, or default)
- Added logging about the parsed storage type
- Fixed an inconsistency in the parseStorageType method to ensure it returns StorageType.SQLITE when the storage type is not specified

### 4. Enhanced Logging in Main.java
- Added logging about the Java version, JavaFX version, and operating system
- Added more detailed logging about the storage type configuration initialization
- Added try-catch blocks around the Gluon internal classes fixes initialization and the application bootstrapping
- Added logging about the current storage type before bootstrapping the application

### 5. Enhanced Logging in GluonInternalClassesFix.java
- Added logging about the Java version and classpath information
- Added detailed logging about the attempts to fix LicenseManager and TrackingManager
- Added logging about the class loader and class location
- Added logging about the fields being examined and modified
- Added logging to verify the changes made to fields

## Benefits
These logging enhancements provide several benefits:
1. **Better Diagnostics**: The detailed logging will help identify exactly where and why issues are occurring
2. **Improved Troubleshooting**: The additional information about class loading, database connections, and field modifications will make it easier to troubleshoot issues
3. **Clearer Error Messages**: The enhanced exception logging will provide more context about errors
4. **Configuration Verification**: The logging about configuration settings will help verify that the application is using the expected configuration

## Relation to Requirements
This implementation addresses the issue described in the task:
> Add logger to the relevant files to ascertain what is causing this: [log output]

The enhanced logging will provide the information needed to diagnose what is causing the issues with Gluon's internal classes initialization and SQLite database configuration.
