# Implementation: Order Assignment to Workers

## Task Description
Add support for order assignment to workers as specified in the implementation task list.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created OrderAssignment Class
Created a new value object class `OrderAssignment` to track assignment history:
- Stores who assigned the order, who it was assigned to, when, and any notes
- Immutable value object with proper validation
- Supports tracking unassignment by allowing null assignedTo

### 2. Enhanced OrderBusiness Class
Added the following features to the OrderBusiness class:

#### Assignment History Tracking
- Added a list to track assignment history: `private final List<OrderAssignment> assignmentHistory = new ArrayList<>()`
- Added a method to get the assignment history: `getAssignmentHistory()`

#### Assignment Methods
- Added `assignTo(UserBusiness worker, UserReference assignedBy, String notes)` method:
  - Validates that the worker has the PRODUCTION role
  - Creates an OrderAssignment record
  - Adds the assignment to the history
  - Updates the assignedTo field
  - Returns true if the assignment was successful

- Added `reassignTo(UserBusiness newWorker, UserReference assignedBy, String notes)` method:
  - Validates that the new worker has the PRODUCTION role
  - Checks if this is actually a reassignment (different worker)
  - Creates an OrderAssignment record
  - Adds the assignment to the history
  - Updates the assignedTo field
  - Returns true if the reassignment was successful

- Added `unassign(UserReference unassignedBy, String reason)` method:
  - Creates an OrderAssignment record with null assignedTo
  - Adds the unassignment to the history
  - Updates the assignedTo field to null
  - Returns true if the order was unassigned

#### Helper Methods
- Added `isAssigned()` method to check if an order is currently assigned
- Deprecated the existing `setAssignedTo(UserReference)` method in favor of the new methods

## Benefits
This implementation provides several benefits:
1. **Role Validation**: Ensures that orders can only be assigned to users with the PRODUCTION role
2. **Assignment History**: Tracks the complete history of assignments and reassignments
3. **Audit Trail**: Records who made each assignment and when
4. **Notes Support**: Allows adding notes to explain assignments or reassignments
5. **Unassignment Support**: Provides a way to unassign orders with a reason

## Relation to Requirements
This implementation satisfies the third task in the Order Management section of the implementation task list:
> Add support for order assignment to workers

The implementation provides a complete solution for managing order assignments, which is essential for the workflow management functionality in the BelSign system.
