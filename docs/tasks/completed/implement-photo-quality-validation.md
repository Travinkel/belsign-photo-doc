# Implementation: Photo Quality and Metadata Validation

## Task Description
Implement validation for photo quality and metadata as specified in the implementation task list.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created PhotoMetadata Class
Created a new value object class `PhotoMetadata` to store and validate technical information about photos:
- Resolution (width and height in pixels)
- File size (in bytes)
- Image format (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
- Color space (e.g., RGB, CMYK)
- DPI (dots per inch, optional)

The class includes validation in the constructor to ensure all values are valid, and provides methods to access derived properties like resolution, megapixels, and aspect ratio.

### 2. Enhanced PhotoDocument Class
Modified the `PhotoDocument` class to include metadata support:
- Added a `metadata` field to store photo metadata
- Added the field to the Builder class
- Added a method to set metadata in the Builder
- Added methods to get and set metadata in PhotoDocument

### 3. Updated PhotoQualitySpecification
Enhanced the `PhotoQualitySpecification` class to validate photo metadata:
- Added validation for the presence of metadata
- Added validation for minimum resolution (1280x720 pixels)
- Added validation for file size (between 100KB and 10MB)
- Added validation for image format (must be JPEG or PNG)
- Added validation for color space (must be RGB)
- Added validation for DPI (at least 72 DPI if provided)

### 4. Created Comprehensive Tests
Created a test class `PhotoQualitySpecificationTest` with tests for:
- Valid photo document with valid metadata
- Missing metadata
- Low resolution
- Small file size
- Large file size
- Invalid image format
- Invalid color space
- Low DPI
- Null DPI (which is valid since it's optional)
- Multiple validation failures

## Benefits
This implementation provides several benefits:
1. **Quality Assurance**: Ensures that photos meet minimum quality standards before being included in reports
2. **Consistency**: Enforces consistent photo formats and specifications across the system
3. **Error Prevention**: Catches quality issues early in the process, reducing the need for retakes
4. **User Guidance**: Provides clear validation messages that help users understand what needs to be fixed

## Relation to Requirements
This implementation satisfies the second task in the Domain Layer section of the implementation task list:
> Implement validation for photo quality and metadata

The implementation provides a complete solution for validating photo quality and metadata, which is essential for ensuring that photos meet the quality standards required for documentation purposes.
