# Implementation: Photo Templates with Required Fields

## Task Description
Add support for photo templates with required fields as specified in the implementation task list.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created RequiredField Enum
Created a new enum `RequiredField` to represent different types of required fields for photo templates:
- `ANNOTATIONS`: Indicates that the photo must have at least one annotation
- `METADATA`: Indicates that the photo must have metadata
- `MEASUREMENTS`: Indicates that the photo must include measurement annotations
- `DEFECT_MARKING`: Indicates that the photo must mark any defects or issues
- `REFERENCE_POINTS`: Indicates that the photo must include reference points
- `TIMESTAMP`: Indicates that the photo must include a timestamp
- `LOCATION`: Indicates that the photo must include location information

### 2. Enhanced PhotoTemplate Class
Modified the `PhotoTemplate` class to support required fields:
- Added a `requiredFields` parameter to the record
- Updated the constructor to validate and handle the required fields
- Added a factory method `of(String name, String description)` for creating templates without required fields
- Added the `isFieldRequired(RequiredField field)` method to check if a field is required
- Added the `getRequiredFieldsDescription()` method to get a description of the required fields
- Updated all predefined templates with appropriate required fields

### 3. Updated PhotoQualitySpecification
Enhanced the `PhotoQualitySpecification` class to validate required fields:
- Added validation for required annotations
- Added validation for required measurements
- Added validation for required defect markings
- Added validation for required reference points
- Added validation for required metadata
- Added the `hasAnnotationOfType(PhotoDocument document, PhotoAnnotation.AnnotationType type)` helper method
- Improved the metadata validation logic to handle required vs. recommended metadata

### 4. Created Comprehensive Tests
Created two test classes to verify the implementation:
- `PhotoTemplateTest`: Tests the PhotoTemplate class's required fields functionality
  - Constructor with required fields
  - Constructor with null required fields
  - Factory method with no required fields
  - isFieldRequired method
  - getRequiredFieldsDescription method
  - Predefined templates
- `PhotoQualitySpecificationRequiredFieldsTest`: Tests the PhotoQualitySpecification class's validation of required fields
  - Photo with all required fields
  - Photo missing required annotations
  - Photo missing required metadata
  - Photo missing required measurements
  - Photo with no required fields

## Benefits
This implementation provides several benefits:
1. **Improved Quality Control**: Ensures that photos have all the required information based on their template
2. **Clearer Requirements**: Makes it explicit what information is required for each type of photo
3. **Flexible Validation**: Allows different templates to have different requirements
4. **Better User Guidance**: Provides clear validation messages that help users understand what needs to be added

## Relation to Requirements
This implementation satisfies the third task in the Domain Layer section of the implementation task list:
> Add support for photo templates with required fields

The implementation provides a complete solution for specifying and validating required fields for photo templates, which is essential for ensuring that photos meet the quality standards required for documentation purposes.
