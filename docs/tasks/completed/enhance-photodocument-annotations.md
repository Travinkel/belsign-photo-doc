# Enhancement: PhotoDocument Annotation Support

## Task Description
Enhance the PhotoDocument entity to support annotations as specified in the implementation task list.

## Implementation Details

### Changes Made
1. Added three new methods to the PhotoDocument class:
   - `addAnnotation(PhotoAnnotation)`: Adds a new annotation to the photo document
   - `removeAnnotation(String)`: Removes an annotation by its ID
   - `updateAnnotation(PhotoAnnotation)`: Updates an existing annotation with a new one having the same ID

2. Each method includes:
   - Proper validation (null checks)
   - Updates to the lastModifiedAt timestamp when changes are made
   - Return values indicating whether the operation was successful

### Testing
Created a comprehensive test class `PhotoDocumentTest` that verifies:
- The getAnnotations() method returns an unmodifiable list of annotations
- The addAnnotation() method correctly adds a new annotation
- The removeAnnotation() method correctly removes an annotation by its ID
- The updateAnnotation() method correctly updates an existing annotation
- All methods properly handle edge cases (null values, non-existent annotations)

## Benefits
These enhancements provide several benefits:
1. **Improved Usability**: Users can now add, remove, and update annotations on existing photo documents
2. **Better Documentation**: Annotations allow for more detailed documentation of photos
3. **Enhanced Quality Control**: QA personnel can add annotations to highlight issues or important features
4. **Richer User Experience**: The ability to annotate photos makes the application more interactive and useful

## Relation to Requirements
This implementation satisfies the first task in the Domain Layer section of the implementation task list:
> Enhance PhotoDocument entity to support annotations

The implementation provides a complete solution for managing annotations on photo documents, which is a key requirement for the photo documentation system.
