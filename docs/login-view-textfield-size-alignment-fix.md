# Login View Textfield Size and Alignment Fix

## Issue Description
The textfields in the login view were too small, and the alignment of elements needed improvement.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Textfield Size
Modified the `.login-field` class in `views.css`:
- Increased minimum and preferred height from 48px to 56px
- Adjusted padding from `16px` to `12px 16px` for better vertical space
- Added explicit alignment (`-fx-alignment: center-left`) for text within fields

### 2. Added Tablet-Optimized Input Styling
Created a new `.tablet-optimized-input` class with enhanced styling for tablet use:
- Larger height (60px) for better touch targets
- Increased font size (20px) for better readability
- More generous padding (12px 20px)
- Larger border radius (14px) for modern appearance
- Subtle shadow effect for depth
- Enhanced focus state with stronger shadow and thicker border

### 3. Improved Field Container Alignment
Enhanced the `.field-container` class and added a tablet-optimized version:
- Added consistent spacing (8px) between label and input
- Created `.tablet-optimized-field` with increased spacing (10px) and bottom padding
- Ensured input containers take full width with `-fx-min-width: 100%`

### 4. Added Tablet-Optimized Form Container
Created a new `.tablet-optimized-form` class for better form layout:
- Increased spacing (20px) between form elements
- Added padding (16px) around form content
- Set alignment to top-center for consistent vertical alignment
- Added subtle background color for visual separation
- Added rounded corners for a cohesive design

## Result
These changes make the login view more user-friendly, especially on tablets, with:
- Larger touch targets for better usability
- Improved spacing and alignment for better visual hierarchy
- Consistent styling that aligns with the tablet-first approach of the application

The textfields are now appropriately sized and all elements in the login view are properly aligned, addressing the requirements specified in the issue description.
