# Login View Alignment Fix

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to fix alignment issues in the login view of the Belsign Photo Documentation application. The login view had a horizontal split with a vertical separator, but the separator was missing the "OR" text that was mentioned in the issue description.

## Changes Made

The following changes were made to fix the alignment issues:

1. **Added "OR" Text to Vertical Separator**
   - Modified the vertical separator in the login view to include an "OR" text between two vertical lines
   - Used the existing `separator-label` style class for the "OR" text
   - Split the single vertical line into two shorter lines (80px each) to make room for the "OR" text

## Technical Implementation

The implementation involved changes to the LoginView.fxml file:

```xml
<!-- Before -->
<VBox alignment="CENTER" styleClass="vertical-separator-container">
    <Line startX="0" startY="0" endX="0" endY="200" styleClass="vertical-separator-line"/>
</VBox>

<!-- After -->
<VBox alignment="CENTER" styleClass="vertical-separator-container">
    <VBox alignment="CENTER" spacing="10.0">
        <Line startX="0" startY="0" endX="0" endY="80" styleClass="vertical-separator-line"/>
        <Label text="OR" styleClass="separator-label"/>
        <Line startX="0" startY="0" endX="0" endY="80" styleClass="vertical-separator-line"/>
    </VBox>
</VBox>
```

The changes leverage existing CSS styles:

- `.vertical-separator-container` - Provides padding and alignment for the separator
- `.vertical-separator-line` - Styles the vertical lines with appropriate color and opacity
- `.separator-label` - Styles the "OR" text with appropriate font size, color, and weight

## Benefits

The updated login view offers several benefits:

1. **Improved User Experience**
   - Clearer visual separation between login methods
   - More intuitive indication that the two login methods are alternatives
   - Better alignment with the issue description's requirement for "a horizontal split with or in between"

2. **Consistent Design**
   - Uses existing style classes for consistent appearance
   - Maintains the clean, modern look of the application
   - Follows the established design patterns

## Future Considerations

While the current changes address the immediate alignment issues, future improvements could include:

1. Adding animations for transitions between login states
2. Enhancing the responsive behavior for different screen sizes
3. Further refining the visual design of the separator
