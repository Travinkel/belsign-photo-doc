# Belsign Photo Documentation - Testing Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the Belsign Photo Documentation project. It provides guidelines for different types of tests, testing tools, and best practices to ensure the quality and reliability of the application.

## Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of our testing strategy are:

1. **Ensure Functionality**: Verify that all features work as specified in the requirements
2. **Maintain Quality**: Prevent regressions and ensure code quality
3. **Improve Reliability**: Identify and fix issues before they reach production
4. **Support Refactoring**: Enable safe refactoring and code improvements
5. **Document Behavior**: Tests serve as executable documentation of expected behavior

## Test Categories

The project employs a comprehensive testing approach with different categories of tests:

### 1. Unit Tests

**Purpose**: Test individual components in isolation.

**Location**: `src/test/java/com/belman/unit`

**Organization**:
- Organized by layer (presentation, service, bootstrap)
- Further organized by domain areas (admin, worker, security)

**Tools**:
- JUnit 5 for test execution
- Mockito for mocking dependencies

**Best Practices**:
- Focus on testing a single unit of functionality
- Mock all external dependencies
- Aim for high coverage of business logic
- Keep tests fast and independent

**Example**:
```java
@Test
void testStringConcatenation() {
    String part1 = "Hello";
    String part2 = "World";
    String result = part1 + " " + part2;

    assertEquals("Hello World", result, "String concatenation should work correctly");
    System.out.println("[DEBUG_LOG] String concatenation test passed");
}
```

### 2. Integration Tests

**Purpose**: Test interactions between components.

**Location**: `src/test/java/com/belman/integration`

**Organization**:
- Database integration tests
- Service integration tests
- Worker flow integration tests
- Order processing integration tests

**Tools**:
- JUnit 5 for test execution
- Test database with known data

**Best Practices**:
- Initialize the test database with `TestDatabaseUtil.initializeTestDatabase()`
- Reset the database before each test with `TestDatabaseUtil.resetTestDatabase()`
- Shutdown the database after tests with `TestDatabaseUtil.shutdownTestDatabase()`
- Test complete workflows across multiple components

### 3. Architecture Tests

**Purpose**: Verify architectural constraints.

**Location**: `src/test/java/com/belman/architecture`

**Organization**:
- Three-layer architecture tests
- MVVM pattern tests
- Antipattern tests

**Tools**:
- ArchUnit for defining and testing architectural rules

**Best Practices**:
- Define clear architectural boundaries
- Test for unwanted dependencies between layers
- Verify that patterns are correctly implemented

### 4. Clean Code Tests

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and maintainability.

**Location**: `src/test/java/com/belman/cleancode`

**Organization**:
- Code complexity tests
- Design pattern tests
- Exception handling tests

**Tools**:
- Custom test utilities for measuring complexity
- Reflection-based tests for pattern verification

**Best Practices**:
- Set clear thresholds for code complexity
- Verify proper implementation of design patterns
- Ensure consistent exception handling

### 5. UI Testing

**Purpose**: Test the user interface and user interactions.

**Location**: `src/test/java/com/belman/ui`

**Challenges**:
- JavaFX Toolkit initialization issues in JUnit
- Mockito limitations with JavaFX classes
- Property binding complexities

**Approach**:
1. Test the ViewModel logic without JavaFX dependencies
2. Create testable implementations for JavaFX components
3. Test controllers using reflection and avoiding JavaFX mocking
4. Create simplified tests focusing on core logic

## Test Coverage Requirements

The project aims for the following test coverage targets:

1. **Business Logic**: 90% line coverage
2. **Service Layer**: 80% line coverage
3. **Presentation Layer**: 70% line coverage
4. **Overall Project**: 75% line coverage

Coverage is measured using JaCoCo and reported in the CI pipeline.

## Testing Workflow

### Local Development

1. **Write Tests First**: Follow TDD principles where appropriate
2. **Run Tests Locally**: Use Maven or IDE to run tests before committing
3. **Check Coverage**: Use JaCoCo reports to identify untested code

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# Run a specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=com.belman.unit.test.SimpleTest

# Run a specific test method
mvn test -Dtest=com.belman.unit.test.SimpleTest#testStringConcatenation

# Run tests in a specific package
mvn test -Dtest=com.belman.unit.presentation.*

# Run architecture tests
mvn test -Dtest=com.belman.architecture.rules.*
```

### Continuous Integration

1. **Automated Testing**: All tests run automatically on push/PR
2. **Report Generation**: Test reports generated and published
3. **Quality Gates**: PRs blocked if tests fail or coverage drops

## Test Data Management

### Test Database

- SQLite database used for testing
- Initialized with known test data
- Reset between test runs to ensure isolation

### Mock Data

- Mock repositories available for faster test execution
- Test data factories for generating test entities
- Fixtures for common test scenarios

## Debugging Tests

1. **Debug Logging**: Add debug logs with the "[DEBUG_LOG]" prefix:
```java
System.out.println("[DEBUG_LOG] Your debug message here");
```

2. **Test Reports**: Use the custom test report generator for detailed reports:
```bash
java -cp target/classes com.belman.test.reporting.XmlReportConverter --format=html
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test Independence**: Tests should not depend on each other
2. **Clear Assertions**: Use descriptive assertion messages
3. **Test Edge Cases**: Include tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios
4. **Clean Setup/Teardown**: Properly initialize and clean up test resources
5. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive test method names
6. **Single Responsibility**: Each test should verify one aspect of behavior
7. **Avoid Test Logic**: Minimize conditional logic in tests
8. **Fast Execution**: Keep tests fast to encourage frequent running

## Conclusion

This testing strategy provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring the quality and reliability of the Belsign Photo Documentation project. By following these guidelines, we can maintain high standards of code quality, prevent regressions, and support ongoing development and refactoring efforts.
