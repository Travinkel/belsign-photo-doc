# Belsign Photo Documentation Improvement Task List

## Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive task list for improving the Belsign Photo Documentation application, focusing on both technical implementation and UX/design aspects. The tasks are organized into categories as specified in the requirements, with each task including a clear description, files to modify, expected outcome, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort.

The goal is to create a more professional, consistent, and user-friendly interface while maintaining the application's existing functionality. The tasks address specific issues identified in the current implementation, including:

1. Inconsistent styling across different views
2. Excessive white space in some views (particularly PhotoCubeView)
3. Poor layout in the login view (vertical layout with awkward OR separator)
4. Button styling issues (clipping into borders)
5. Inefficient use of screen space in views
