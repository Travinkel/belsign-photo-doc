# Photo Data Access Adapter Changes

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to implement the PhotoDataAccessAdapter, which adapts the InMemoryPhotoRepository to the PhotoDataAccess interface. These changes are part of the ongoing architecture overhaul to ensure the module package doesn't depend on other layers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created InMemoryPhotoRepository

The `InMemoryPhotoRepository` class was created in the `com.belman.repository.persistence` package to implement the `PhotoRepository` interface. This implementation stores photo documents in memory and is suitable for development and testing.

```java
public class InMemoryPhotoRepository extends BaseService implements PhotoRepository {
    private final Map<PhotoId, PhotoDocument> photosById = new HashMap<>();
    private final Map<OrderId, List<PhotoId>> photoIdsByOrderId = new HashMap<>();

    // Constructor and method implementations
}
```

The implementation includes a helper method to convert between the `PhotoDocument.ApprovalStatus` enum and the `com.belman.domain.user.ApprovalStatus` enum, which are different types but have the same values.

### 2. Created PhotoDataAccessAdapter

The `PhotoDataAccessAdapter` class was created in the `com.belman.repository.persistence` package to implement the `PhotoDataAccess` interface and adapt the existing `PhotoRepository`. This adapter follows the Adapter pattern, delegating all method calls to the underlying repository.

```java
public class PhotoDataAccessAdapter implements PhotoDataAccess {
    private final PhotoRepository repository;

    // Constructor and method implementations
}
```

### 3. Updated ApplicationInitializer

The `ApplicationInitializer` class was updated to create and register instances of `InMemoryPhotoRepository` and `PhotoDataAccessAdapter`. The changes were made in three places:

1. In the try block where SQL repositories are used
2. In the catch block where in-memory repositories are used as fallbacks
3. In the else block where in-memory repositories are used when the database is not available

```
// Initialize PhotoRepository - use InMemoryPhotoRepository for now
logger.database("Creating InMemoryPhotoRepository");
photoRepository = new InMemoryPhotoRepository();
ServiceRegistry.registerService(photoRepository);
logger.success("Using InMemoryPhotoRepository");

// Create and register PhotoDataAccessAdapter
logger.database("Creating PhotoDataAccessAdapter");
PhotoDataAccess photoDataAccess = new PhotoDataAccessAdapter(photoRepository);
ServiceRegistry.registerService(photoDataAccess);
logger.success("PhotoDataAccessAdapter created successfully");
```

## Architecture Benefits

These changes provide several benefits to the architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The module package defines what it needs (through interfaces) without depending on how it's implemented.

2. **Dependency Inversion**: The business layer depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

3. **Testability**: The business layer can be tested with mock implementations of the interfaces.

4. **Flexibility**: The data layer can change its implementation details without affecting the business layer.

5. **Maintainability**: The codebase is easier to maintain because changes in one layer don't ripple through other layers.

## Future Work

As part of the ongoing architecture overhaul, the following tasks should be considered:

1. Create audit events for photo-related operations to replace the existing domain events.

2. Update the PhotoApprovalService and PhotoValidationService to use the BusinessService base class.

3. Consider creating similar data access adapters for other business components.
