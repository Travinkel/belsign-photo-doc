# Customer Module Architecture Changes

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to implement the CustomerDataAccessAdapter, which adapts the InMemoryCustomerRepository to the CustomerDataAccess interface. These changes are part of the ongoing architecture overhaul to ensure the module package doesn't depend on other layers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created CustomerDataAccessAdapter

The `CustomerDataAccessAdapter` class was created in the `com.belman.repository.persistence` package to implement the `CustomerDataAccess` interface and adapt the existing `InMemoryCustomerRepository`. This adapter follows the Adapter pattern, converting between `CustomerAggregate` (used by the repository) and `CustomerBusiness` (used by the business layer).

```java
public class CustomerDataAccessAdapter implements CustomerDataAccess {
    private final InMemoryCustomerRepository repository;
    
    // Constructor and method implementations
}
```

The adapter implements all methods from the `CustomerDataAccess` interface, including the `findBySpecification` method, which is specific to the customer module. It uses the `AbstractSpecification` class to create a specification that works with `CustomerAggregate` objects but evaluates them using a specification for `CustomerBusiness` objects.

### 2. Updated ApplicationInitializer

The `ApplicationInitializer` class was updated to create and register an instance of `CustomerDataAccessAdapter` when the `CustomerRepository` is an instance of `InMemoryCustomerRepository`. This ensures that the business layer can access customer data through the `CustomerDataAccess` interface without depending on the data layer implementation details.

The changes were made in three places:
1. In the try block where SQL repositories are used
2. In the catch block where in-memory repositories are used as fallbacks
3. In the else block where in-memory repositories are used when the database is not available

## Architecture Benefits

These changes provide several benefits to the architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The module package defines what it needs (through interfaces) without depending on how it's implemented.

2. **Dependency Inversion**: The business layer depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

3. **Testability**: The business layer can be tested with mock implementations of the interfaces.

4. **Flexibility**: The data layer can change its implementation details without affecting the business layer.

5. **Maintainability**: The codebase is easier to maintain because changes in one layer don't ripple through other layers.

## Future Work

As part of the ongoing architecture overhaul, similar changes should be made for other repositories and services to ensure that the module package doesn't depend on other layers. The following tasks should be considered:

1. Create data access interfaces for other business objects (OrderBusiness, ReportBusiness, etc.).

2. Create adapter implementations for these interfaces in the data layer.

3. Update the ApplicationInitializer to register these adapters.

4. Update the business layer to use these interfaces instead of concrete repository implementations.
