# Architecture Overhaul Summary Update

## Changes Made in This Session

In this session, I've made the following changes to continue the architecture overhaul:

1. **Created InMemoryPhotoRepository**:
   - Created a new class `InMemoryPhotoRepository` in the `com.belman.repository.persistence` package
   - This class implements the `PhotoRepository` interface and stores photo documents in memory
   - Added a helper method to convert between `PhotoDocument.ApprovalStatus` and `com.belman.domain.user.ApprovalStatus`

2. **Created PhotoDataAccessAdapter**:
   - Created a new class `PhotoDataAccessAdapter` in the `com.belman.repository.persistence` package
   - This class implements the `PhotoDataAccess` interface and adapts the `PhotoRepository` interface
   - It delegates all method calls to the underlying repository

3. **Updated ApplicationInitializer**:
   - Updated the import statements to include the new classes
   - Added code to create and register the `InMemoryPhotoRepository` and `PhotoDataAccessAdapter`
   - Added this code in three places: the try block, the catch block, and the else block

4. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Created `photo_data_access_adapter_changes.md` to document the changes made
   - Updated `architecture_overhaul_progress.md` to include the Photo module changes
   - Updated `MASTER_TASK_LIST.md` to mark the tasks related to PhotoDataAccessAdapter as completed
   - Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to mark the tasks related to PhotoDataAccessAdapter as completed

## Architecture Benefits

The changes made in this session provide several benefits to the architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The module package defines what it needs (through interfaces) without depending on how it's implemented.

2. **Dependency Inversion**: The business layer depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

3. **Testability**: The business layer can be tested with mock implementations of the interfaces.

4. **Flexibility**: The data layer can change its implementation details without affecting the business layer.

5. **Maintainability**: The codebase is easier to maintain because changes in one layer don't ripple through other layers.

## Next Steps

The next steps for continuing the architecture overhaul are:

1. **Create OrderAuditEvents**:
   - Create audit events for order-related operations to replace the existing domain events
   - These events should extend `BaseAuditEvent` and be used to track significant changes to orders

2. **Create PhotoAuditEvents**:
   - Create audit events for photo-related operations to replace the existing domain events
   - These events should extend `BaseAuditEvent` and be used to track significant changes to photos

3. **Update PhotoApprovalService**:
   - Update the `PhotoApprovalService` to use the `BusinessService` base class
   - This will ensure that the service follows the new architecture guidelines

4. **Update PhotoValidationService**:
   - Update the `PhotoValidationService` to use the `BusinessService` base class
   - This will ensure that the service follows the new architecture guidelines

5. **Update OrderBusinessService**:
   - Update the `OrderBusinessService` to use the `BusinessService` base class
   - This will ensure that the service follows the new architecture guidelines

These next steps will continue the transition from DDD terminology to business terminology and ensure proper separation of concerns throughout the codebase.
