# Architecture Overhaul Summary

## Changes Made in This Session

In this session, I've made the following changes to continue the architecture overhaul:

1. **Created ComponentDataAccessInterface**:
   - Created a new interface `ComponentDataAccessInterface` in the `com.belman.domain.core` package
   - This interface is similar to `DataAccessInterface` but works with `BusinessComponent` instead of `BusinessObject`
   - It includes methods for finding, saving, deleting, and counting business components

2. **Created PhotoDataAccess Interface**:
   - Created a new interface `PhotoDataAccess` in the `com.belman.domain.order.photo` package
   - This interface extends `ComponentDataAccessInterface<PhotoDocument, PhotoId>`
   - It adds methods specific to photo documents: `findByOrderId`, `findByStatus`, and `findByOrderIdAndStatus`

3. **Updated Documentation**:
   - Created `photo_module_changes.md` to document the changes made to the Photo module
   - Updated `architecture_overhaul_progress.md` to include the Photo module in the "Completed Tasks" section
   - Updated `MASTER_TASK_LIST.md` to mark the tasks related to PhotoDataAccess as completed
   - Updated `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` to mark the tasks related to PhotoDataAccess as completed

## Architecture Benefits

The changes made in this session provide several benefits to the architecture:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: The module package defines what it needs (through interfaces) without depending on how it's implemented.

2. **Dependency Inversion**: The business layer depends on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.

3. **Consistency**: The architecture now has a consistent approach for both business objects and business components.

4. **Flexibility**: The data layer can change its implementation details without affecting the business layer.

## Next Steps

The next steps for continuing the architecture overhaul are:

1. **Create PhotoDataAccessAdapter**:
   - Create a new class `PhotoDataAccessAdapter` in the `com.belman.dataaccess.persistence` package
   - This class should implement `PhotoDataAccess` and adapt an existing repository implementation
   - It should convert between `PhotoDocument` and the repository's entity type

2. **Update ApplicationInitializer**:
   - Update `ApplicationInitializer` to register the `PhotoDataAccessAdapter`

3. **Continue with Order Module**:
   - Create `OrderAuditEvents` to replace `OrderEvents`
   - Create `PhotoAuditEvents` to replace `PhotoEvents`
   - Update `PhotoApprovalService.java` to use `BusinessService`
   - Update `PhotoValidationService.java` to use `BusinessService`
   - Update `OrderBusinessService.java` to use `BusinessService`

4. **Continue with Report Module**:
   - Update `ReportBusiness.java` to use `BusinessObject`
   - Create `ReportAuditEvents` to replace `ReportEvents`
   - Update `PhotoReportGenerationService.java` to use `BusinessService`

5. **Update Exceptions**:
   - Update `AccessDeniedException.java` to extend `BusinessException`
   - Update `BusinessRuleViolationException.java` to extend `BusinessException`
   - Update `EntityNotFoundException.java` to extend `BusinessException`
   - Update `InvalidValueException.java` to extend `BusinessException`
