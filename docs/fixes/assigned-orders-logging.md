# Assigned Orders Logging

## Issue Description

We're experiencing an issue where assigned orders aren't loading properly for production users in SQLite mode. To diagnose this issue, we've added comprehensive logging throughout the codebase to track the flow of data and identify where the problem might be occurring.

## Logging Enhancements

We've added detailed logging to the following components:

### 1. SqlUserRepository.findById

Added logging to track:
- User ID being searched for
- SQL query execution
- Whether a user was found
- User details (ID, Username, Roles)
- Error conditions

### 2. SqlUserRepository.mapResultSetToUser

Added logging to track:
- User ID from database and created UserId object
- Username from database
- Name from database and parsed first/last name
- Email from database
- Status from database
- Approval state based on status
- Creating UserBusiness object
- NFC ID from database
- UserBusiness object created with ID and username
- Loading roles for user
- User roles loaded

### 3. SqlUserRepository.loadUserRoles

Added logging to track:
- Loading roles for user with ID
- SQL query execution
- Added role to user
- Loaded role count for user
- Warning if no roles found for user
- Error conditions

## How to Use This Logging

When running the application in SQLite mode with a production user, look for the following in the logs:

1. Check if the production user is being found in the database:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlUserRepository: Finding user by ID: <user_id>
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlUserRepository: User found in database, mapping to UserBusiness
   ```

2. Verify that the user has the PRODUCTION role:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlUserRepository: Loaded <count> roles for user: <user_id>
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlUserRepository: Added role to user: PRODUCTION
   ```

3. Check if orders are being found in the database:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlOrderRepository: Found <count> total orders
   ```

4. Verify that orders have the correct assigned_to field:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlOrderRepository: Assigned to user ID from DB: <user_id>
   ```

5. Check if the assigned user is being found:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlOrderRepository: Fetching assigned user with ID: <user_id>
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlOrderRepository: User found: ID=<user_id>, Username=<username>, Roles=[<roles>]
   ```

6. Verify that the order is being assigned to the user:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] SqlOrderRepository: Setting order assignedTo: ID=<user_id>, Username=<username>
   ```

7. Check if the filtering logic is working correctly:
   ```
   [DEBUG_LOG] AssignedOrderViewModel: Order <order_id> assigned to <user_id> - matches current user: <true/false>
   ```

## Troubleshooting

If assigned orders aren't loading, look for these potential issues in the logs:

1. **User not found**: Check if the user exists in the database and has the correct ID.
2. **Missing PRODUCTION role**: Verify that the user has the PRODUCTION role.
3. **No orders in database**: Check if there are any orders in the database.
4. **Orders not assigned**: Verify that orders have the assigned_to field set.
5. **Case sensitivity issues**: Look for differences in case between user IDs in the database and in the code.
6. **SQL errors**: Check for any SQL errors in the logs.

## Next Steps

After running the application with this enhanced logging, collect the logs and analyze them to identify the root cause of the issue. Once identified, we can implement a targeted fix.
