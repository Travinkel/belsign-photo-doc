# Project Structure Update

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to the project structure and provides recommendations for future development.

## Changes Made

1. **Created a Multi-Module Maven Project Structure**
   - Created separate modules for athomefx, athomefx-cli, belsign, and nidhugg
   - Updated the parent pom.xml to include all modules
   - Created pom.xml files for each module with appropriate dependencies

2. **Restructured Resources and Test Folders**
   - Moved resources to the appropriate modules
   - Created test directories in each module
   - Organized test files according to Maven conventions

3. **Restructured Nidhugg Module**
   - Created a proper Maven directory structure
   - Organized packages according to domain-driven design principles
   - Created a pom.xml file for the module

## Issues to Address

1. **Package Name Issues**
   - Many files still reference the old package structure (e.g., `com.belman.belsign.framework.athomefx.di.Inject`)
   - These references need to be updated to the new package structure (e.g., `di.Inject`)
   - This affects all Java files in the project

2. **Maven Configuration Issues**
   - The mainClass in the belsign module's pom.xml needs to be updated to the new package structure
   - Dependencies between modules need to be properly configured

3. **Test Failures**
   - Tests are failing due to package name issues
   - Once package names are fixed, tests should be run to verify the changes

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Fix Package Name Issues**
   - Update all import statements to reference the new package structure
   - Update all package declarations to match the new structure
   - This can be done gradually, focusing on one module at a time

2. **Improve Maven Configuration**
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly declared in each module's pom.xml
   - Use dependency management in the parent pom.xml to ensure consistent versions
   - Configure the build plugins appropriately for each module

3. **Add More Tests**
   - Add tests for all modules to ensure they work correctly
   - Use integration tests to verify that modules work together properly
   - Implement continuous integration to run tests automatically

4. **Improve Documentation**
   - Update documentation to reflect the new project structure
   - Add Javadoc comments to all classes and methods
   - Create a developer guide for working with the project

5. **Consider Further Modularization**
   - Evaluate whether additional modules would improve the project structure
   - Consider creating separate modules for different aspects of the application
   - Ensure that modules have clear responsibilities and dependencies

## Conclusion

The project has been restructured to follow Maven best practices for multi-module projects. This will make it easier to maintain, test, and extend the codebase. However, there are still issues to address, particularly with package names and Maven configuration. Addressing these issues should be a priority for future development.
