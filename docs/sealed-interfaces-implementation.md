# Sealed Interfaces Implementation

## Summary

This document provides a summary of the implementation of sealed interfaces in the AtHomeFX framework. The implementation includes:

1. **Stage Interface**: A sealed interface that represents a window in the application, with three implementations:
   - `DesktopStage`: For desktop platforms
   - `IPadStage`: For iPad platforms
   - `SmartPhoneStage`: For smartphone platforms

2. **Scene Interface**: A sealed interface that represents a scene in the application, with three implementations:
   - `LoginScene`: For login screens
   - `PhotoScene`: For photo screens
   - `AdminScene`: For admin screens

3. **Documentation**: A comprehensive documentation file that explains the sealed interfaces and their implementations, including examples of how to use them.

4. **Example Application**: A JavaFX application that demonstrates the usage of the sealed interfaces in a real application.

## Implementation Details

### Stage Interface

The `Stage` interface is a sealed interface that permits only the `DesktopStage`, `IPadStage`, and `SmartPhoneStage` implementations. This ensures that only these three implementations can be used, providing type safety and enabling pattern matching.

Each implementation wraps a JavaFX Stage and provides platform-specific behavior:

- `DesktopStage`: Allows resizing and has no default size
- `IPadStage`: Has a fixed size of 1024x768 and ignores resize requests
- `SmartPhoneStage`: Has a fixed size of 390x844 and ignores resize requests

### Scene Interface

The `Scene` interface is a sealed interface that permits only the `LoginScene`, `PhotoScene`, and `AdminScene` implementations. This ensures that only these three implementations can be used, providing type safety and enabling pattern matching.

Each implementation wraps a JavaFX Parent node and provides scene-specific behavior:

- `LoginScene`: A basic scene for login screens
- `PhotoScene`: A scene for photo screens with methods for taking and saving photos
- `AdminScene`: A scene for admin screens with methods for user management

### Pattern Matching

The implementation demonstrates the use of pattern matching with sealed interfaces, which is a feature introduced in Java 17. Pattern matching allows for more concise and safer code when handling different implementations of a sealed interface.

For example, the `getStageType` method uses pattern matching to determine the type of a Stage:

```java
private String getStageType(Stage stage) {
    return switch (stage) {
        case DesktopStage ignored -> "Desktop";
        case IPadStage ignored -> "iPad";
        case SmartPhoneStage ignored -> "Smartphone";
    };
}
```

Similarly, the `getSceneType` method uses pattern matching to determine the type of a Scene:

```java
private String getSceneType(Scene scene) {
    return switch (scene) {
        case LoginScene ignored -> "Login";
        case PhotoScene ignored -> "Photo";
        case AdminScene ignored -> "Admin";
    };
}
```

## Assessment

The implementation meets the requirements specified in the issue description:

1. **Sealed Interfaces**: The implementation uses sealed interfaces for Stage and Scene, which permits only specific implementations.
2. **Records**: The implementation uses records for value objects, which provides immutability and automatic implementations of equals, hashCode, and toString.
3. **Pattern Matching**: The implementation demonstrates the use of pattern matching with sealed interfaces.
4. **Platform-Specific Behavior**: The implementation provides platform-specific behavior for different stage types.
5. **Screen-Specific Functionality**: The implementation provides screen-specific functionality for different scene types.

The implementation also follows best practices for JavaFX application development:

1. **Clean Architecture**: The implementation follows a clean architecture approach with clear separation of concerns.
2. **Immutability**: The implementation uses immutable objects where appropriate.
3. **Type Safety**: The implementation provides type safety through sealed interfaces.
4. **Pattern Matching**: The implementation uses pattern matching for more concise and safer code.
5. **Documentation**: The implementation includes comprehensive documentation.

## Recommendations for Further Improvements

1. **Add More Scene Types**: Add more scene types to the Scene interface to cover all the screens in the application.
2. **Add More Stage Types**: Add more stage types to the Stage interface to cover all the platforms the application will run on.
3. **Add More Platform-Specific Behavior**: Add more platform-specific behavior to the stage implementations, such as different window decorations or different ways of handling user input.
4. **Add More Screen-Specific Functionality**: Add more screen-specific functionality to the scene implementations, such as different ways of handling user input or different ways of displaying data.
5. **Add Tests**: Add more tests to verify that the sealed interfaces work as expected.
6. **Add Documentation**: Add more documentation to explain how to use the sealed interfaces in different scenarios.
7. **Add Examples**: Add more examples to demonstrate the usage of the sealed interfaces in different scenarios.

## Conclusion

The implementation of sealed interfaces in the AtHomeFX framework provides a solid foundation for building cross-platform JavaFX applications. The use of sealed interfaces, records, and pattern matching makes the code more concise, safer, and easier to maintain. The implementation follows best practices for JavaFX application development and provides a good example of how to use modern Java features in a real application.
