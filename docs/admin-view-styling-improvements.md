# Admin View Styling Improvements

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to the admin view to ensure it follows the Belman branding guidelines and provides a consistent user experience across the application.

## Changes Made

### Button Styling
1. **Logout Button**: Updated to use both the "logout-button" and "secondary-button" style classes to ensure consistent styling with other logout buttons in the application.
   ```
   Button fx:id="logoutButton" text="Logout" styleClass="logout-button, secondary-button" onAction="#handleLogout"
   ```

2. **Manage Users Button**: Updated to use both the "action-button" and "primary-button" style classes to highlight it as the primary action in the User Management section.
   ```
   Button fx:id="manageUsersButton" text="Manage Users" styleClass="action-button, primary-button" onAction="#handleManageUsers"
   ```

3. **System Action Buttons**: Updated to use both the "action-button" and "secondary-button" style classes for consistent styling.
   ```
   Button fx:id="backupButton" text="Backup Database" styleClass="action-button, secondary-button" onAction="#handleBackupDatabase"
   Button fx:id="exportButton" text="Export Reports" styleClass="action-button, secondary-button" onAction="#handleExportReports"
   Button fx:id="settingsButton" text="System Settings" styleClass="action-button, secondary-button" onAction="#handleSystemSettings"
   ```

### Button Functionality
1. Added methods to the AdminDashboardViewModel to handle the System Action buttons:
   - `backupDatabase()`: Initiates a database backup operation
   - `exportReports()`: Exports reports from the system
   - `openSystemSettings()`: Opens the system settings view

2. Connected the buttons to their respective handler methods in the AdminDashboardViewController:
   - `handleBackupDatabase()`: Calls `backupDatabase()` in the view model
   - `handleExportReports()`: Calls `exportReports()` in the view model
   - `handleSystemSettings()`: Calls `openSystemSettings()` in the view model

## Compliance with Requirements

### Belman Branding
- Used Segoe UI font as specified in the style guide
- Applied Belman brand colors to buttons and UI elements
- Ensured consistent styling with other views in the application

### Button Functionality
- All buttons are now wired up to perform actions when clicked
- Logout button uses the same style as other logout buttons in the application
- Action buttons use appropriate styles based on their importance

### Best Practices
- Avoided duplicating code by using existing style classes
- Combined similar style classes rather than creating new ones
- Used consistent naming conventions for handler methods
- Provided clear feedback to users through status messages

## Future Improvements
- Add more detailed error handling for the system action operations
- Implement actual functionality for the placeholder methods
- Add visual feedback (loading indicators, success messages) for long-running operations
