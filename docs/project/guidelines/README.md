# BelSign Photo Documentation System - Guidelines

## Overview

This directory contains guidelines for developing the BelSign Photo Documentation System. These guidelines are based on the project requirements and architectural decisions, and are designed to ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality of the codebase.

## Guidelines Documents

The guidelines are divided into several documents, each focusing on a specific aspect of the development process:

1. [Development Guidelines](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) - General guidelines for developing the BelSign Photo Documentation System
2. [Design Patterns](DESIGN_PATTERNS.md) - Guidelines for using design patterns in the system
3. [Testing Guidelines](TESTING_GUIDELINES.md) - Guidelines for testing the system
4. [Three-Layer Architecture Guidelines](../../test/java/com/belman/architecture/rules/threelayer/THREE_LAYER_GUIDELINES.md) - Guidelines for implementing the three-layer architecture

## Development Guidelines

The [Development Guidelines](DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md) document provides a comprehensive overview of the development process for the BelSign Photo Documentation System. It covers:

- Project overview and requirements
- Architecture and layer responsibilities
- Coding standards and naming conventions
- User interface guidelines
- Mobile compatibility considerations
- Documentation requirements
- Version control practices
- Build and deployment procedures

This document serves as the primary reference for developers working on the project.

## Design Patterns

The [Design Patterns](DESIGN_PATTERNS.md) document provides guidance on using design patterns in the BelSign Photo Documentation System. It covers:

- Structural patterns (Repository, Adapter, Facade)
- Creational patterns (Factory Method, Builder, Dependency Injection)
- Behavioral patterns (Observer, Command, Strategy)
- Architectural patterns (MVVM, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design)
- Implementation guidelines and best practices
- Testing design pattern implementations

This document helps developers understand which design patterns to use and how to implement them effectively.

## Testing Guidelines

The [Testing Guidelines](TESTING_GUIDELINES.md) document provides guidance on testing the BelSign Photo Documentation System. It covers:

- Testing approach and strategy
- Test types (unit, integration, architecture, UI)
- Test organization and naming conventions
- Test data management
- Mocking and test doubles
- Architecture testing
- Test coverage goals
- Continuous integration
- Test documentation

This document helps developers ensure that the system is thoroughly tested and meets the quality requirements.

## Three-Layer Architecture Guidelines

The [Three-Layer Architecture Guidelines](../../test/java/com/belman/architecture/rules/threelayer/THREE_LAYER_GUIDELINES.md) document provides specific guidance on implementing the three-layer architecture in the BelSign Photo Documentation System. It covers:

- Layer definitions and responsibilities
- Dependency rules between layers
- Component placement guidelines
- Naming conventions
- Architecture tests
- Best practices
- Example implementations

This document helps developers understand how to structure the code according to the three-layer architecture.

## Using These Guidelines

Developers should familiarize themselves with these guidelines before starting work on the BelSign Photo Documentation System. The guidelines should be followed throughout the development process to ensure consistency and quality.

When in doubt, refer to the appropriate guideline document for guidance. If the guidelines do not address a specific issue, discuss it with the team to establish a consistent approach.

## Contributing to the Guidelines

These guidelines are not set in stone and may evolve as the project progresses. If you have suggestions for improving the guidelines, please discuss them with the team and update the documents accordingly.

When updating the guidelines, ensure that:

1. The changes are consistent with the project requirements and architectural decisions
2. The changes are clearly documented and explained
3. The team is informed of the changes
4. The changes are reflected in the architecture tests where applicable

## Conclusion

Following these guidelines will help ensure that the BelSign Photo Documentation System is developed in a consistent, maintainable, and high-quality manner. The guidelines provide a common understanding of the development process and help the team work together effectively.
