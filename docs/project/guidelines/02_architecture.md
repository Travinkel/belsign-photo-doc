# Architecture

## Overview
The BelSign Photo Documentation Module follows a clean, layered architecture based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. This architecture ensures separation of concerns, maintainability, and testability while providing a solid foundation for future extensions.

## Architectural Principles
- **Clean Architecture**: Dependency flows inward, with domain at the center
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain model with entities, value objects, and aggregates
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one reason to change
- **Interface Segregation**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use
- **Open/Closed Principle**: Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests are written before code to ensure quality and correctness
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through events, promoting loose coupling
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Long-running tasks are handled asynchronously to keep the UI responsive
- **Modular Design**: Components are organized into modules for better maintainability and scalability
- **Microservices**: The architecture can be extended to support microservices for scalability and deployment flexibility
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The architecture supports both desktop and mobile platforms, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices
- **Responsive Design**: The UI adapts to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a seamless experience on various devices
- **Accessibility**: The application is designed to be accessible to users with disabilities, following best practices for UI design
- **Security**: The architecture incorporates security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure secure communication between components
- **Performance Optimization**: The architecture is designed to optimize performance, ensuring fast response times and efficient resource usage

## Interface-Based Design

The architecture employs interface-based design to achieve high modularity, loose coupling, and ease of testing. By defining clear interfaces for services, repositories, and external integrations, the system ensures:

- **Decoupling:** Components rely only on interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
- **Flexibility:** Easy substitution or extension of implementations without modifying client code.
- **Testability:** Simplified mocking and testing through dependency injection of interfaces.

### Practical Usage in Layers:

- **Domain Layer:** Repository interfaces define contracts without exposing infrastructure details.
- **Application Layer:** Service interfaces abstract orchestration and business logic from specific implementations.
- **Infrastructure Layer:** Concrete implementations of repositories and services fulfill domain-defined interfaces.

**Example:**
```java
// Domain layer interface
public interface OrderRepository {
    Optional<Order> findById(OrderId id);
    void save(Order order);
}

// Infrastructure layer implementation
public class SqlOrderRepository implements OrderRepository {
    @Override
    public Optional<Order> findById(OrderId id) {
        // implementation details
    }

    @Override
    public void save(Order order) {
        // implementation details
    }
}
```

## Layers
The application is organized into the following layers:

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **Purpose**: User interface and user interaction
- **Components**: Views, ViewModels, Controllers
- **Technologies**: JavaFX, FXML, Backbone framework
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Display information to users
  - Capture user input
  - Validate user input
  - Delegate business logic to application services

### 2. Application Layer
- **Purpose**: Orchestration of domain objects and services
- **Components**: Application Services, DTOs, ViewModels
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Coordinate domain objects to perform use cases
  - Transaction management
  - Security and authorization
  - Mapping between domain objects and DTOs

### 3. Domain Layer
- **Purpose**: Business logic and rules
- **Components**: Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services, Repositories (interfaces)
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement business rules
  - Define domain model
  - Express business concepts and relationships
  - Define repository interfaces

### 4. Infrastructure Layer
- **Purpose**: Technical capabilities and external systems integration
- **Components**: Repository Implementations, External Services, Persistence, File I/O
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Implement repository interfaces
  - Provide technical services (email, file storage)
  - Integrate with external systems
  - Handle persistence concerns

## Key Components

### Domain Model
The domain model is at the heart of the application and includes:

- **Entities**: Objects with identity (e.g., Order, User, PhotoDocument)
- **Value Objects**: Immutable objects without identity (e.g., PhotoAngle, EmailAddress)
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of entities and value objects (e.g., Order with PhotoDocuments)
- **Domain Services**: Operations that don't belong to a specific entity (e.g., ReportBuilderService)
- **Repositories**: Interfaces for data access (e.g., OrderRepository, UserRepository)

### Backbone Framework
The application uses the Backbone framework, a Gluon Mobile-friendly, opinionated JavaFX micro-framework that follows Clean Architecture principles:

- **Base Classes**: BaseView, BaseController, BaseViewModel
- **Dependency Injection**: ServiceLocator, Inject annotation
- **Event Handling**: DomainEvent, DomainEventPublisher
- **State Management**: StateStore, Property
- **Navigation**: Router for SPA-style navigation
- **Lifecycle Management**: ViewLifecycle, onShow(), onHide()

## Design Patterns

### MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel-Controller)
- **Model**: Domain entities and services
- **View**: FXML files and view classes
- **ViewModel**: Mediates between View and Model, handles UI logic
- **Controller**: Manages user interactions and delegates to ViewModel

### Supporting Concepts
- **Data Binding**: JavaFX properties for reactive UI updates
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: onShow() and onHide() methods for view lifecycle management
- **Dependency Injection**: ServiceLocator for managing dependencies
- **Event Handling**: DomainEventPublisher for event-driven architecture
- **Navigation**: Router for SPA-style navigation

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **State Management**: StateStore for global state management
- **Asynchronous Operations**: JavaFX Task for background processing
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling through the ErrorHandler class
- **Logging**: SLF4J for logging and monitoring
- **Testing**: JUnit and Mockito for unit and integration testing
- **Documentation**: JavaDoc and Markdown for API documentation

### Repository Pattern
- Abstracts data access logic
- Provides collection-like interface for domain objects
- Decouples domain from persistence mechanisms

### Specification Pattern
- Encapsulates query criteria (e.g., PendingOrdersSpecification)
- Enables composable, reusable query logic
- Keeps domain logic in the domain layer

### Service Locator
- Centralized registry for services
- Enables dependency injection
- Simplifies testing through service substitution

### Observer Pattern
- Used for event handling
- Enables loose coupling between components
- Implemented through the DomainEventPublisher

## Communication Flow
1. User interacts with the View
2. View delegates to Controller
3. Controller updates ViewModel
4. ViewModel executes Application Service methods
5. Application Service orchestrates Domain objects
6. Domain objects implement business logic
7. Repositories persist changes
8. Results flow back up through the layers

## Threading Model
- UI components run on the JavaFX Application Thread
- Long-running operations run on background threads
- Services use JavaFX Task for asynchronous operations
- Results are published back to the UI thread using Platform.runLater()

## Mobile Compatibility
The architecture supports both desktop and mobile platforms:
- Platform-specific styling
- Responsive layouts
- Touch-friendly UI components
- Offline capabilities through local storage
