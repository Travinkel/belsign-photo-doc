Production Workers from Belman A/S

Problem description
As part of Belmans quality control, they are developing a system for their production. This system is called Belsign

Belsign is a larger system that manages the production, where one part of this is quality control.

Belman has requested help to develop this part of Belsign.

The Problem
Right before Belman ships an item from production, they need to document the joints, weldings, etc. through photo documentation.

Right now they are taking photos with a camera and these photos are then uploaded to a server in one big folder.

This makes it hard to find images upon the request of customers or in case of quality issues.

Solution
Belman would like a system that is able to

Attach images to an orderAggregate number and save them to a DB
Autogenerate QC reports
Enable sending of emails with QC documentation directly to customers
It is also important that the GUI is

Very user friendly, as production workers are non-technical, must be easy to add pictures and follow the process
Able to generate a reportAggregate preview
The system must be designed to be tablet friendly (requirement), as it ultimately must run on a tablet (not a requirement)
The system has multiple user groups

Production worker (Taking the pictures)
Qualitity assurance employees (Approving the documentation)
Admin (Assigns roles to employees)
This is only the basic requirements for the program. More requirements may arise during meetings with the company.

2. Requirements
From the Academy’s point of view, the project is a learning process and the outcome of the project is used as the foundation for the project exam that will take place in June. Therefore, there are several requirements for how the project is implemented and documented. First of all, the software development methodology taught during the 2nd semester must be applied, and the development process must be documented. ScrumWise must be used throughout the project.

The time frame for the project includes sprint reviews, in which representatives for the end user/product owner and one or more of the teachers participate. These sessions should focus on the functional requirements and the usability of the application. See Time Table for the schedule of these sprint reviews.

The more specific project requirements are divided into the following categories

Project planning and execution
Programming Requirements
They are described in the following subsections.

Project planning and execution
You should develop a project plan including:

Problem definition

Product Vision

The vision for the Product – Why do we want this? (Elevator pitch)
The target group – Who are the target customers and users for the product? (Product stakeholders)
The needs – What pains/problems does the product solve? (Value proposition)
Product - An overall feature list (3-5 Main Epic Stories)
The business goals – How will this benefit the company
Strategic Analysis

Stakeholder analysis
Risk Analysis (From what we know, do we see any potential risks and how will we handle them)
Project organization

Roles in your Team (Scrum-roles)
What software the team will use to support collaboration (Git? Scrumwise?)
Team collaboration policies (meeting times, decision making, delegation of tasks, etc.) (Working Agreement/Group Contract)

Overall schedule for the whole project (main project timeline)

An initial Product Backlog

Sprint Burndown Charts (A Scrum Artifact viewed and followed during each sprint)

Sprint Review summaries and reflections (A Scrum Ceremony used at the end of each sprint)

Programming Requirements
The system must be implemented in Java as a desktop application and handed in as an IntelliJ project.

You must implement the program in Java, use JavaFX for the GUI and the schools MSSQL database for persistence.

You should pay special attention to the source code, so it appears readable and well structured.

You must use the 3-layered architecture.

You must use design patterns in design and implementation and these must be documented in the reportAggregate.

At least one of the core classes must be tested through an automated JUnit test.

Installation guides, passwords and other information needed by examiners, must be prepared and included in appendices to the reportAggregate.

3. Report Requirements
You can assume that the reader of the reportAggregate has an in-depth knowledge of the terminologies, techniques and tools presented throughout the first two semes­ters at the Computer Science Study.

It will be highly weighted that the reportAggregate has a good layout, is understandable and complete, according to the needs of the reader. Regarding the content of the reportAggregate it will be highly weighted that you are arguing precisely for important decisions about the models, structures, limitations etc.

The reportAggregate should be readable both at a superior and a detailed level. This re­quires that the reportAggregate contains an introduction, including a problem definition and a conclusion. It should make sense to the reader reading just these two parts of the reportAggregate. The introduction must state which limitations you have set for your project.

The size of the reportAggregate is minimum 20 pages and maximum 40 pages per group, not counting front page, table of contents, reference list, and appendices for the reportAggregate. The maximum size is not a goal but should be an upper limit. It will be fine if you are able to make a good reportAggregate with fewer pages. One page is 2400 characters including spaces and footnotes.

The reportAggregate must contain part of your source code in a readable form. The part of source code to include in the reportAggregate must cover your solution(s) in a vertical sense. It means that the included source code must be examples from all layers. Further the examples must be selected such it is possible to follow the implementation from the upper layer (GUI for instance), passing the business layer, and ending at the data access layer. Remember also to include the business entities used.

Structure of Report
The following is proposal to the structure of the reportAggregate

Front page with project title, date, names of group members and name of education must be included.

Table of contents

1. Introduction
1.1. Background
1.2. Problem definition
1.3. Product vision
1.4. Strategic analysis

2. Pre-Game/Background
2.1. Project organization
2.2. Overall Project schedule
2.3. Initial product backlog
2.4. Architecture

3. Sprint 1
3.1. Sprint planning
3.2. Daily meetings
3.3. GUI
3.4. Data model
3.5. Implementation
3.5.1. Code examples
3.5.2. Design Patterns
3.5.3. Unit test
3.6. Sprint Review
3.7. Sprint Retrospective

4. Sprint 2
4.1. Sprint Planning …

5. Unit test

6. Multi-threading and Concurrency

7. Conclusion
Evaluate your work – both the product and the work process.
It should be clear which of the project goals from the system vision have been met and which have not… and why.

8. References
Use APA or Harvard reference style

9. Appendices

This is only a proposal. Be critical of the sections/headlines, e.g. do not write a section called "Design Patterns", if you did not implement any design patterns in that sprint. Same goes for Unit test.

4. Handing in
The date and time for handing in the final reportAggregate is

2nd of June 2025, at 10:00

The hand-in must be done using WiseFlow - details about how to complete a hand-in of the exam project will be given during the project. But essential you will upload two documents to the WiseFlow server:

The reportAggregate in .pdf format
A zip-file containing the software project
WiseFlow is an automated hand-in system, that will check your reportAggregate for plagiarism. You have an individual responsibility to check your work. This means that you are individually responsible for the project handed in. Plagiarism is a serious offence and in some cases can result in being expelled from the academy. If in doubt if something is plagiarism, ask a teacher for advice.

5. Exam
The exam is composed of a group presentation and an individual exam.

Group Presentation (10 minutes)
Individual Exam (30 minutes)
The 30 minutes includes the examiner(s) voting and grading. The mark is a single individual overall mark based on the written component (including the developed system) and the oral presentation and examination.

The purpose of the group presentation is to demonstrate the overall program and its functionality.

The individual exam will be a dialogue between the examiners and the student. The student, starts by presenting an interesting part of the program that (s)he has made, the exam then progresses into a dialogue that can address all topics from curriculum.

Schedule
The exam will be completed in two tracks; one for the Danish class and for the international class.

CSe24A - Room ?
16th, 17th, and 18th of June Exact plan TBA

CSe24B - Room ?
12th, 13th, and 16th of June Exact plan TBA

If you fail the exam there is re-examination on the 24th of June. Talk to the teachers about your options and more details on how to proceed right after failing.

Generally you must contact Charlotte (ct@easv.dk) first to attend the re-examination.

Absence due to sickness
If you are sick at the day of the exam and therefore are unable to take an examination you must inform the academy at once on telephone 76 13 32 00.

By sickness you must send a medical statement not later than 48 hours after the day of exam, subsequently you are admitted a new exam at a later date.
