## Static Code Analysis Tools

Integrated static code analysis tools to improve code quality and identify potential issues early in the development process:

### SpotBugs Integration
- Added SpotBugs Maven plugin (version 4.7.3.6) to the build process
- Configured SpotBugs with maximum effort and medium threshold for bug detection
- Created a comprehensive exclude filter file (spotbugs-exclude.xml) to:
  - Exclude test classes and generated code from analysis
  - Ignore false positives in JavaFX-specific code patterns
  - Exclude specific bug patterns that are not relevant for this project
- Integrated the analysis into the verify phase of the Maven build lifecycle
- Set failOnError to false to prevent build failures during initial adoption

### PMD Integration
- Added PMD Maven plugin (version 3.20.0) to the build process
- Configured PMD with appropriate rulesets:
  - Best practices
  - Code style
  - Design
  - Error-prone code
  - Multithreading
  - Performance
- Integrated Copy-Paste Detection (CPD) to identify duplicated code
- Excluded generated code from analysis
- Configured the plugin to run during the verify phase of the Maven build lifecycle

These tools provide several benefits:
- Early detection of potential bugs and code quality issues
- Enforcement of coding standards and best practices
- Identification of security vulnerabilities
- Detection of duplicated code
- Continuous code quality monitoring during the build process

The initial analysis has been run successfully, establishing a baseline for future improvements. The team can now address the identified issues incrementally, focusing on the most critical ones first.

## Domain Model Improvements

Strengthened the domain model by enhancing key value objects with better validation, documentation, and functionality:

### EmailAddress Value Object Improvements
- Enhanced class-level documentation explaining the purpose and usage of email addresses in the system
- Implemented a more comprehensive RFC 5322 compliant regex pattern for email validation
- Added better error messages that specify whether the email is null, empty, or invalid
- Implemented additional utility methods:
  - `getLocalPart()`: Extracts the local part of the email address (before the @ symbol)
  - `getDomainPart()`: Extracts the domain part of the email address (after the @ symbol)
- Improved input validation with trimming of whitespace

### OrderNumber Value Object Improvements
- Added comprehensive class-level documentation explaining the purpose and format of order numbers
- Enhanced the regex pattern to capture component groups for easier extraction
- Implemented a factory method `of()` to create OrderNumber instances from component parts:
  - Department code (1-2 digits)
  - Year (2 digits)
  - Customer code (6 digits)
  - Sequential number (8 digits)
- Added getter methods for each component of the order number:
  - `getDepartmentCode()`
  - `getYear()`
  - `getCustomerCode()`
  - `getSequentialNumber()`
- Improved validation with specific error messages for each component

These improvements enhance the domain model by:
- Making value objects more self-documenting and easier to understand
- Providing richer functionality that encapsulates business concepts
- Ensuring stricter validation to prevent invalid data
- Adding utility methods that make working with these objects more convenient
- Maintaining immutability and encapsulation principles

All tests pass with these improvements, confirming that they integrate well with the existing codebase.

## Next Steps
The next priorities should be:
1. Adding integration tests for component interactions
2. Implementing UI tests for comprehensive testing
3. Implementing other medium-priority tasks

## Testing
All tests pass with the implemented changes, confirming that the improvements work correctly and don't break existing functionality.
