## Implementation Details

### ErrorHandler Implementation
Created a new `ErrorHandler` class in the `com.belman.backbone.core.exceptions` package that provides:
- Centralized error logging
- User-friendly error dialogs
- Quiet error handling options
- Async error handling support
- Consistent error handling patterns

### Exception Handling Standardization
Updated exception handling in the `DefaultPhotoService` class to use the new `ErrorHandler`:
- Replaced direct logging with `errorHandler.handleException` and `errorHandler.handleExceptionQuietly`
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive
- Ensured consistent error handling patterns across the class

### Test Coverage Reporting
Added JaCoCo Maven plugin for test coverage reporting:
- Configured JaCoCo to prepare the agent for test coverage collection
- Set up report generation after tests are run
- Reports are generated in the target/site/jacoco directory

### Test Isolation Improvements
Enhanced test isolation in email service tests:
- Replaced real SMTP server configurations with test-specific configurations
- Used JUnit's @TempDir for temporary file creation in tests
- Added proper cleanup of test resources
- Improved test assertions to verify expected behavior
- Made tests more deterministic and independent of external resources

### Dependency Updates
- Updated the MSSQL JDBC driver to a version compatible with Java 21
- Added Jakarta Mail for email functionality
- Updated SLF4J to the latest version for improved logging

### Build Configuration
- Configured the Maven Shade plugin to create an executable JAR
- Set up proper manifest configuration for the executable JAR
- Added appropriate filters for META-INF files

## Unit Test Coverage Improvements
Added comprehensive unit tests for critical domain components:
- Created UserTest for the User aggregate with 25 test methods covering:
  - Constructor validation
  - Property setters and getters
  - Role management (adding, removing roles)
  - Status management (activation, deactivation, locking)
  - Status query methods (isActive, isInactive, isLocked, isPending)

- Created OrderTest for the Order aggregate with 25 test methods covering:
  - Constructor validation
  - Property setters and getters
  - Photo management (adding photos, filtering approved/pending photos)
  - Status query methods (isReadyForQaReview, isApproved, isRejected, isDelivered)

These tests significantly increase the test coverage of the domain layer, which is the core of the application.

## Mobile Compatibility Improvements

### Enhanced Responsive Layouts
Implemented comprehensive responsive layout improvements to ensure the application adapts well to different screen sizes and devices:

1. **CSS Enhancements**:
   - Added responsive sizing variables for consistent spacing and touch targets
   - Enhanced typography with text wrapping for better display on small screens
   - Improved button styles with touch-friendly sizing
   - Added styles for form controls with appropriate touch target sizes
   - Enhanced list and table views for better mobile display
   - Added styles for layout containers with consistent spacing
   - Expanded the responsive styles for tablet and smartphone platforms
   - Added utility classes for responsive containers and images

2. **FXML Improvements**:
   - Updated SplashView.fxml to use responsive styling and image handling
   - Enhanced MainView.fxml with flexible layouts and proper spacing
   - Improved PhotoUploadView.fxml with responsive form controls and list views
   - Removed fixed dimensions in favor of flexible, percentage-based layouts
   - Used appropriate layout containers (VBox, HBox) with proper growth constraints
   - Added descriptive comments for better code organization

These changes ensure that the UI adapts appropriately to different screen sizes and orientations, providing a consistent user experience across desktop and mobile devices.

## Touch Interaction Optimizations

Implemented comprehensive touch interaction improvements to make the application more responsive and user-friendly on touch devices:

1. **Enhanced Button Interactions**:
   - Added subtle drop shadow effects for better visual hierarchy
   - Implemented smooth transition animations for all interactive elements
   - Added hover effects with scaling and shadow changes
   - Added pressed effects with scaling, shadow reduction, and vertical translation
   - Implemented color changes for different button states (hover, pressed)

2. **Form Control Enhancements**:
   - Added border styling with subtle colors and transitions
   - Implemented focus effects with colored borders and subtle glows
   - Added hover effects with darker border colors
   - Increased size of checkboxes and radio buttons for better touch targets
   - Added scaling effects for checkboxes and radio buttons on hover

3. **List Cell Improvements**:
   - Created a touch-friendly list cell (TouchFriendlyPhotoListCell) with:
     - Structured layout with status indicator and vertical arrangement of information
     - Visual hierarchy with different font sizes and weights
     - Text wrapping for all labels to handle different screen sizes
     - Color-coded status indicators (green for approved, red for rejected, amber for pending)
     - Proper spacing and padding for better touch targets
     - Clear separation of information with dedicated labels

4. **Dialog Enhancements**:
   - Created a touch-friendly dialog component (TouchFriendlyDialog) with:
     - Colored title bar based on dialog type (information, error, warning, confirmation)
     - Touch-friendly buttons with appropriate sizing (min-width: 120px, min-height: 48px)
     - Text wrapping for both title and message labels
     - Proper spacing and padding for better touch targets
     - Visual hierarchy with different font sizes and weights

5. **Camera Integration**:
   - Created a camera service interface (CameraService) to abstract platform-specific camera functionality
   - Implemented a mock camera service (MockCameraService) for testing purposes
   - Updated the photo upload controller to use the camera service for taking photos and selecting from gallery
   - Added proper error handling and user feedback for camera operations

These improvements make the application more responsive and engaging for touch interactions, with better visual feedback and touch targets. The structured layouts and visual hierarchy also make the information easier to read and understand on mobile devices.

## Camera Integration Optimizations

Implemented comprehensive camera integration improvements to enhance the user experience when capturing and managing photos:

1. **Camera Service Abstraction**:
   - Created a `CameraService` interface to abstract platform-specific camera functionality
   - Implemented a `MockCameraService` for desktop testing
   - Created a `CameraServiceFactory` to provide the appropriate implementation based on platform
   - Designed for future extension with real mobile implementations

2. **Asynchronous Processing**:
   - Moved camera operations to background threads to prevent UI freezing
   - Added proper JavaFX Platform.runLater() calls for UI updates
   - Implemented comprehensive error handling for all camera operations
   - Added cancellation handling for when users abort photo capture/selection

3. **Progress Indication**:
   - Added a progress indicator to provide visual feedback during camera operations
   - Implemented button disabling during operations to prevent concurrent actions
   - Added clear success/failure messages after operations complete
   - Ensured consistent UI state management across all operations

4. **Responsive UI**:
   - Updated the PhotoUploadView layout to use a StackPane for proper progress indicator overlay
   - Ensured all UI elements are properly re-enabled after operations complete
   - Added proper error handling with user-friendly error messages
   - Implemented consistent visual feedback for all camera-related operations

These improvements make the camera integration more robust, user-friendly, and maintainable, with better error handling and visual feedback.

## Next Steps
The next priorities should be:
1. Addressing security concerns
2. Adding more tests for other components

## Testing
All existing tests pass with the implemented changes, confirming that the improvements don't break existing functionality.
