# BelSign Project Improvement Progress

This document tracks the progress of implementing the improvements identified in the [Prioritized Improvement Tasks](prioritized-improvement-tasks.md) document.

## Completed Tasks

### Code Quality
- ✅ **Remove debug print statements**: Removed `System.out.println` statements from production code in `Main.java`
- ✅ **Standardize exception handling**: Implemented consistent exception handling across the application using a centralized ErrorHandler
- ✅ **Complete interface-based design**: Ensured all services and repositories follow interface-based design
- ✅ **Enhance error handling**: Implemented a centralized error handling mechanism with the `ErrorHandler` class

### Testing
- ✅ **Add test coverage reporting**: Integrated JaCoCo for test coverage reporting
- ✅ **Improve test isolation**: Enhanced test isolation in email service tests

### Build and Deployment
- ✅ **Update dependencies**: Updated SLF4J to version 2.0.9
- ✅ **Fix MSSQL JDBC driver version**: Updated to version 12.4.2.jre11 which is compatible with Java 21
- ✅ **Add email dependency**: Added Jakarta Mail 2.0.1 for email functionality
- ✅ **Configure executable JAR creation**: Set up Maven Shade plugin for creating executable JARs

## Implementation Details

### ErrorHandler Implementation
Created a new `ErrorHandler` class in the `com.belman.backbone.core.exceptions` package that provides:
- Centralized error logging
- User-friendly error dialogs
- Quiet error handling options
- Async error handling support
- Consistent error handling patterns

### Exception Handling Standardization
Updated exception handling in the `DefaultPhotoService` class to use the new `ErrorHandler`:
- Replaced direct logging with `errorHandler.handleException` and `errorHandler.handleExceptionQuietly`
- Improved error messages to be more descriptive
- Ensured consistent error handling patterns across the class

### Test Coverage Reporting
Added JaCoCo Maven plugin for test coverage reporting:
- Configured JaCoCo to prepare the agent for test coverage collection
- Set up report generation after tests are run
- Reports are generated in the target/site/jacoco directory

### Test Isolation Improvements
Enhanced test isolation in email service tests:
- Replaced real SMTP server configurations with test-specific configurations
- Used JUnit's @TempDir for temporary file creation in tests
- Added proper cleanup of test resources
- Improved test assertions to verify expected behavior
- Made tests more deterministic and independent of external resources

### Dependency Updates
- Updated the MSSQL JDBC driver to a version compatible with Java 21
- Added Jakarta Mail for email functionality
- Updated SLF4J to the latest version for improved logging

### Build Configuration
- Configured the Maven Shade plugin to create an executable JAR
- Set up proper manifest configuration for the executable JAR
- Added appropriate filters for META-INF files

## Unit Test Coverage Improvements
Added comprehensive unit tests for critical domain components:
- Created UserTest for the User aggregate with 25 test methods covering:
  - Constructor validation
  - Property setters and getters
  - Role management (adding, removing roles)
  - Status management (activation, deactivation, locking)
  - Status query methods (isActive, isInactive, isLocked, isPending)

- Created OrderTest for the Order aggregate with 25 test methods covering:
  - Constructor validation
  - Property setters and getters
  - Photo management (adding photos, filtering approved/pending photos)
  - Status query methods (isReadyForQaReview, isApproved, isRejected, isDelivered)

These tests significantly increase the test coverage of the domain layer, which is the core of the application.

## Next Steps
The next priorities should be:
1. Implementing mobile compatibility improvements
2. Addressing security concerns
3. Adding more tests for other components

## Testing
All existing tests pass with the implemented changes, confirming that the improvements don't break existing functionality.
