# Login View Mobile Icon Fix

## Issue Description
The mobile SVG icon in the right section of the login view was not displaying correctly. The icon was defined in the FXML file but had no specific styling to make it visible.

## Solution
Added CSS styling for both the camera-icon-container and mobile-icon-container classes in the views.css file to ensure consistency and make the mobile icon visible.

### Changes Made

1. Added a new CSS section for icon containers in the login view:

```css
/* 2.9. Icon Containers */
.camera-icon-container, .mobile-icon-container {
    -fx-padding: 16px 0 0 0;
    -fx-alignment: center-right;
    -fx-min-height: 32px;
    -fx-pref-height: 32px;
}
```

### Explanation of Styling Properties

- **-fx-padding: 16px 0 0 0;** - Adds padding above the icon to position it properly within its container
- **-fx-alignment: center-right;** - Aligns the icon to the right side of its container
- **-fx-min-height: 32px;** - Sets a minimum height to ensure the container has enough space to display the icon
- **-fx-pref-height: 32px;** - Sets a preferred height that matches the icon's size (32px as defined in the FXML)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Visual Consistency** - Both the camera icon and mobile icon now have consistent styling
2. **Better User Experience** - The mobile icon is now visible, providing visual cues about mobile functionality
3. **Maintainable Code** - The styling is defined in the CSS file rather than inline in the FXML, following best practices for separation of concerns
