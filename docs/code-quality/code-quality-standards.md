## General Principles

### Clean Code

All code should follow the principles of "Clean Code" as described by Robert C. Martin:

- Code should be simple and direct
- Code should read like well-written prose
- Code should do one thing well
- Code should express intent clearly
- Code should have minimal dependencies

### SOLID Principles

All code should adhere to the SOLID principles:

- **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **I**nterface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use
- **D**ependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules

### DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

Avoid duplication of code and logic. Extract common functionality into reusable methods or classes.

### KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)

Prefer simple solutions over complex ones. Complexity should only be added when necessary.

## Code Organization

### Package Structure

The project follows a three-layer architecture with the following package structure:

```
com.belman
├── domain          # Domain entities and business logic
├── application     # Application services and use cases
├── presentation    # UI components and controllers
├── dataaccess      # Data access and repositories
└── bootstrap       # Application initialization
```

### File Organization

- One primary class per file
- Related classes (e.g., inner classes, enums) may be in the same file
- Maximum file length: 1000 lines (prefer shorter files)
- Order of elements in a class:
  1. Static fields
  2. Instance fields
  3. Constructors
  4. Public methods
  5. Protected methods
  6. Private methods
  7. Inner classes/interfaces

## Naming Conventions

### General

- Names should be descriptive and meaningful
- Avoid abbreviations except for common ones (e.g., ID, UI, DTO)
- Use full words for variable and method names
- Avoid Hungarian notation

### Classes and Interfaces

- Use PascalCase (e.g., `OrderRepository`, `PhotoDocument`)
- Classes should be nouns or noun phrases
- Interfaces should be adjectives, nouns, or noun phrases
- Prefer concrete names over abstract ones

### Methods

- Use camelCase (e.g., `saveOrder`, `getPhotoById`)
- Methods should be verbs or verb phrases
- Boolean methods should be phrased as questions (e.g., `isValid`, `hasPermission`)

### Variables

- Use camelCase (e.g., `orderCount`, `currentUser`)
- Constants should be UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_RETRY_COUNT`)
- Boolean variables should be phrased as questions (e.g., `isActive`, `hasChildren`)

### Packages

- Use lowercase with dots as separators (e.g., `com.belman.domain.order`)
- Package names should be singular (e.g., `model`, not `models`)

## Documentation

### Code Comments

- Use comments to explain "why", not "what" or "how"
- Every public class and method should have a Javadoc comment
- Javadoc should describe the purpose, parameters, return values, and exceptions
- Use `TODO`, `FIXME`, and `NOTE` markers for temporary comments

### Example Javadoc

```java
/**
 * Processes an order and updates its status.
 * 
 * @param orderId The unique identifier of the order to process
 * @param status The new status to set
 * @return true if the order was successfully processed, false otherwise
 * @throws OrderNotFoundException if no order with the given ID exists
 * @throws IllegalStatusTransitionException if the status transition is not allowed
 */
public boolean processOrder(UUID orderId, OrderStatus status) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### Self-Documenting Code

- Prefer self-documenting code over comments
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Extract complex logic into well-named methods
- Use enums instead of magic numbers/strings

## Error Handling

### Exceptions

- Use checked exceptions for recoverable errors
- Use unchecked exceptions for programming errors
- Create custom exceptions for domain-specific errors
- Always include meaningful error messages
- Include the cause when wrapping exceptions

### Null Handling

- Avoid returning null when possible
- Use `Optional<T>` for values that may not exist
- Validate parameters with `Objects.requireNonNull()`
- Document null behavior in Javadoc

### Logging

- Use appropriate log levels (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE)
- Include contextual information in log messages
- Log exceptions with stack traces
- Don't log sensitive information

## Testing

### Test Coverage

- Minimum code coverage requirements:
  - Business Logic: 90%
  - Service Layer: 80%
  - Presentation Layer: 70%
  - Overall Project: 75%

### Test Quality

- Tests should be independent and repeatable
- Tests should have clear assertions
- Tests should cover edge cases and error conditions
- Tests should be fast and reliable

### Test Naming

- Test methods should follow the pattern: `test<MethodName>_<Scenario>_<ExpectedResult>`
- Example: `testSaveOrder_WithValidData_ReturnsOrderId`

## Performance

### General Guidelines

- Avoid premature optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Focus on algorithmic efficiency
- Consider memory usage and garbage collection

### Database Access

- Minimize database round-trips
- Use appropriate indexes
- Use batch operations for bulk updates
- Close resources properly

### UI Performance

- Minimize UI updates
- Use background threads for long-running operations
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Security

### Input Validation

- Validate all user input
- Use parameterized queries for database access
- Sanitize data before display
- Implement proper access control

### Sensitive Data

- Don't log sensitive information
- Don't store passwords in plain text
- Use encryption for sensitive data
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

## Quality Metrics

### Complexity Metrics

- Cyclomatic Complexity: Maximum 15 per method
- Cognitive Complexity: Maximum 15 per method
- Method Length: Maximum 50 lines
- Class Length: Maximum 500 lines
- Parameter Count: Maximum 5 per method

### Maintainability Metrics

- Coupling: Maximum 5 dependencies per class
- Inheritance Depth: Maximum 3 levels
- Fan-out: Maximum 10 method calls to other classes
- Code Duplication: Maximum 5% duplication

## Enforcement

### Automated Tools

- SonarQube for static code analysis
- PMD for additional code quality checks
- JaCoCo for code coverage measurement
- Checkstyle for style enforcement

### Code Reviews

- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Reviews should focus on functionality, maintainability, and adherence to standards
- Use pull requests for code reviews
- Address all review comments before merging

### Continuous Integration

- All quality checks run on CI
- Builds fail if quality standards are not met
- Code coverage reports are generated automatically
- Quality metrics are tracked over time

## Conclusion

Adhering to these code quality standards will help ensure that the Belsign Photo Documentation project remains maintainable, reliable, and secure. These standards should be followed by all developers working on the project.

Remember that these standards are guidelines, not rigid rules. Use your judgment and discuss with the team when exceptions may be warranted.
