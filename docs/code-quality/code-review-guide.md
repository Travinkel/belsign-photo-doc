## Purpose of Code Reviews

Code reviews serve several important purposes:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Identify bugs, logic errors, and edge cases before they reach production
2. **Knowledge Sharing**: Spread knowledge about the codebase and solutions to problems
3. **Consistency**: Ensure code follows project standards and best practices
4. **Mentoring**: Help team members learn and improve their coding skills
5. **Collective Ownership**: Build shared responsibility for the codebase

Effective code reviews lead to higher quality code, fewer bugs, and a more maintainable codebase.

## Code Review Process

### 1. Preparation

Before submitting code for review:

- Ensure all tests pass
- Run static analysis tools (SonarQube, PMD)
- Check code coverage
- Self-review your changes

### 2. Creating a Pull Request

1. Create a pull request with a clear title and description
2. Link to relevant issues or tickets
3. Describe the changes and their purpose
4. Highlight any areas that need special attention
5. Include screenshots for UI changes
6. Add test results if relevant

### 3. Review Assignment

1. Assign at least one reviewer to the pull request
2. Consider assigning both a senior and junior developer for knowledge sharing
3. Avoid always using the same reviewers

### 4. Review Process

1. Reviewers examine the code within 24 hours (when possible)
2. Reviewers leave comments on specific lines or the overall PR
3. Author responds to comments and makes necessary changes
4. Reviewers re-review the updated code
5. Once approved, the code can be merged

### 5. Merge and Cleanup

1. Merge the approved pull request
2. Delete the feature branch if no longer needed
3. Verify the build succeeds after merging
4. Close related issues or tickets

## Reviewer Guidelines

### Attitude and Approach

- **Be respectful and constructive**: Focus on the code, not the person
- **Be specific**: Provide clear examples and explanations
- **Ask questions**: Use questions to understand the author's intent
- **Suggest alternatives**: Offer better solutions when possible
- **Praise good work**: Acknowledge well-written code and clever solutions
- **Prioritize feedback**: Focus on important issues first

### Review Scope

- **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
- **Architecture**: Does the design make sense?
- **Code quality**: Is the code clean, readable, and maintainable?
- **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Tests**: Are there sufficient tests with good coverage?
- **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?

### Time Management

- Aim to review code within 24 hours of assignment
- For large PRs, consider reviewing in multiple sessions
- If you can't review within the expected timeframe, communicate this to the team

## Author Guidelines

### Preparing for Review

- **Keep changes focused**: Each PR should address a single concern
- **Keep PRs small**: Aim for less than 400 lines of code per PR
- **Self-review first**: Review your own code before submitting
- **Provide context**: Explain the purpose and approach in the PR description
- **Highlight complex areas**: Point out areas that might need extra attention

### Responding to Feedback

- **Be open to feedback**: View feedback as an opportunity to improve
- **Respond to all comments**: Even if just to acknowledge
- **Explain your reasoning**: If you disagree, explain why
- **Make requested changes promptly**: Address feedback in a timely manner
- **Ask for clarification**: If you don't understand feedback, ask questions

## Code Review Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing code:

### Functionality

- [ ] Does the code work as expected?
- [ ] Are all edge cases handled?
- [ ] Are error conditions properly handled?
- [ ] Does the code meet the requirements?

### Architecture and Design

- [ ] Does the code follow the project's architectural patterns?
- [ ] Are responsibilities properly separated?
- [ ] Are the right design patterns used?
- [ ] Is the code modular and reusable?
- [ ] Are dependencies minimized and properly managed?

### Code Quality

- [ ] Does the code follow the project's coding standards?
- [ ] Is the code readable and maintainable?
- [ ] Are variables, methods, and classes named clearly?
- [ ] Is there any duplicate code that could be refactored?
- [ ] Are methods and classes focused on a single responsibility?
- [ ] Is the code complexity reasonable?

### Performance

- [ ] Are there any performance concerns?
- [ ] Are database queries optimized?
- [ ] Are resources properly managed (connections closed, etc.)?
- [ ] Is memory usage efficient?
- [ ] Are there any potential concurrency issues?

### Security

- [ ] Is user input properly validated?
- [ ] Are sensitive data properly protected?
- [ ] Are authentication and authorization properly implemented?
- [ ] Are there any potential security vulnerabilities?
- [ ] Are proper security headers and configurations used?

### Testing

- [ ] Are there sufficient unit tests?
- [ ] Are there integration tests where appropriate?
- [ ] Do tests cover edge cases and error conditions?
- [ ] Is the test code clean and maintainable?
- [ ] Is the test coverage adequate?

### Documentation

- [ ] Are public APIs documented with Javadoc?
- [ ] Are complex algorithms or decisions explained in comments?
- [ ] Is the code self-documenting with clear names and structure?
- [ ] Are any necessary external documents updated?

## Handling Feedback

### For Reviewers

- **Be specific and actionable**: Provide clear guidance on what needs to change
- **Explain why**: Help the author understand the reasoning behind your feedback
- **Suggest solutions**: Offer concrete suggestions for improvement
- **Use a consistent tone**: Maintain a professional and respectful tone
- **Prioritize issues**: Distinguish between must-fix issues and nice-to-haves

### For Authors

- **Don't take it personally**: Remember that feedback is about the code, not you
- **Ask for clarification**: If feedback is unclear, ask for more details
- **Explain your reasoning**: If you disagree, explain your perspective
- **Learn from feedback**: Use feedback as an opportunity to improve
- **Thank reviewers**: Acknowledge the time and effort reviewers put in

### Resolving Disagreements

1. **Discuss in the PR**: Start by discussing in the pull request comments
2. **Have a conversation**: If needed, have a face-to-face or video call
3. **Involve a third party**: If agreement can't be reached, involve another team member
4. **Refer to standards**: Use project standards and best practices as a reference
5. **Document decisions**: Document the final decision and reasoning
