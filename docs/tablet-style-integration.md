# Tablet Style Integration Documentation

## Issue Description
The tablet and smartphone optimized style classes have been removed from the LoginView.fxml file as they have been rolled into the default styles.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Tablet-Optimized Style Classes
The following tablet-optimized style classes were removed from the LoginView.fxml file:

1. `tablet-optimized` from the login-card VBox
2. `tablet-optimized-options` from the login-options-container HBox
3. `tablet-optimized-form` from the login-form VBox for username/password
4. `tablet-optimized-field` from the field-container VBox for username and password
5. `tablet-optimized-input` from the login-field TextField and PasswordField
6. `tablet-optimized-button` from the login-button Button
7. `tablet-optimized-separator` from the vertical-separator-container VBox
8. `tablet-optimized-form` from the nfc-login-form VBox
9. `tablet-optimized-icon` from the nfc-icon ImageView
10. `tablet-optimized-text` from the nfc-instruction Label
11. `tablet-optimized-button` from the nfc-button Button
12. `tablet-optimized-helper` from the dev-helper-button Button
13. `tablet-optimized-loading` from the loadingIndicator VBox
14. `tablet-optimized-text` from the loading-label Label

### 2. Reason for Changes
The tablet-optimized styles have been integrated into the default styles, making the separate tablet-optimized classes redundant. This simplifies the CSS structure and makes the application more maintainable.

The CSS files now have comments indicating that the default styles are "Tablet-friendly by default", confirming that the tablet-optimized styles have been rolled into the default styles.

### 3. Benefits of the Changes
- **Simplified FXML**: The FXML file is now cleaner and easier to read without the duplicate style classes.
- **Improved Maintainability**: With styles consolidated in one place, future updates will be easier to implement.
- **Consistent Styling**: All components now use the same styling approach, ensuring consistency across the application.
- **Reduced CSS Size**: Removing duplicate styles reduces the overall size of the CSS files.

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure that the login view still displays correctly with the tablet-optimized styles removed. The appearance should be identical to before, as the styles have been integrated into the default styles.
