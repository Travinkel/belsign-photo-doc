# Architectural Antipatterns Detection

This document summarizes the architectural antipatterns detected in the codebase and provides recommendations for fixing them.

## Overview

The architecture tests have detected several antipatterns in the codebase that should be addressed to improve maintainability, testability, and overall code quality. These antipatterns include:

1. Cyclic dependencies between layers
2. Anemic domain models
3. Feature envy
4. God classes
5. Inappropriate intimacy
6. Law of Demeter violations
7. Service classes depending on concrete implementations

## Detected Antipatterns

### 1. Cyclic Dependencies Between Layers

**Issue**: There are cyclic dependencies between the bootstrap, repository, and service layers. This creates tight coupling and makes the code harder to understand and maintain.

**Examples**:
- Cycle: bootstrap -> repository -> service -> bootstrap
- The bootstrap layer depends on repository classes
- Repository classes extend service base classes
- Service classes use repository implementations

**Recommendations**:
- Break the cycles by introducing interfaces or using dependency inversion
- Move bootstrap code to a dedicated bootstrap layer that sits above all other layers
- Ensure repository implementations depend only on domain interfaces, not service classes
- Use dependency injection to provide dependencies rather than direct instantiation

### 2. Anemic Domain Models

**Issue**: Several domain classes lack behavior methods, making them anemic. Domain classes should encapsulate both data and behavior.

**Examples**:
- `com.belman.domain.core.BusinessComponent`
- `com.belman.domain.core.Entity`
- `com.belman.domain.shared.CommonStateKeys`
- `com.belman.domain.specification.AbstractSpecification$AndSpecification`

**Recommendations**:
- Add behavior methods to domain classes that operate on their data
- Move business logic from service classes to domain classes where appropriate
- Ensure domain classes enforce their own invariants and business rules
- Consider using the Domain-Driven Design approach for rich domain models

### 3. Feature Envy

**Issue**: Many methods use too many methods from other classes, indicating that functionality might be in the wrong place.

**Examples**:
- `Method addGuard in class com.belman.ui.navigation.Router`
- `Method approvePhoto in class com.belman.domain.order.photo.services.PhotoApprovalService`
- `Method authenticate in class com.belman.repository.security.DefaultAuthenticationService`

**Recommendations**:
- Move methods to the classes they're most interested in
- Extract related functionality into new classes
- Use the "Tell, Don't Ask" principle to reduce method calls to other objects
- Consider using the Law of Demeter to limit object interactions

### 4. God Classes

**Issue**: Several classes have too many methods and fields, violating the Single Responsibility Principle.

**Examples**:
- `com.belman.domain.order.OrderBusiness` (27 methods, 9 fields)
- `com.belman.domain.user.UserBusiness` (22 methods, 9 fields)
- `com.belman.ui.base.BaseView` (29 methods, 7 fields)
- `com.belman.ui.views.admin.AdminViewModel` (21 methods, 15 fields)

**Recommendations**:
- Split god classes into smaller, more focused classes
- Extract related functionality into helper classes or components
- Use composition over inheritance to share functionality
- Apply the Single Responsibility Principle to ensure each class has only one reason to change

### 5. Inappropriate Intimacy

**Issue**: Many classes know too much about other classes, creating tight coupling.

**Examples**:
- `com.belman.bootstrap.Main` has inappropriate intimacy with `com.belman.repository.logging.EmojiLogger`
- `com.belman.bootstrap.config.ApplicationInitializer` has inappropriate intimacy with `com.belman.repository.logging.EmojiLogger`
- `com.belman.service.usecase.admin.DefaultAdminService` has inappropriate intimacy with `com.belman.domain.user.UserRepository`

**Recommendations**:
- Reduce dependencies between classes by introducing interfaces
- Use dependency injection to provide dependencies
- Apply the Law of Demeter to limit object interactions
- Consider using the Mediator pattern to reduce direct dependencies

### 6. Law of Demeter Violations

**Issue**: Many methods violate the Law of Demeter, creating tight coupling and making the code harder to maintain.

**Examples**:
- Methods with chains of method calls like `a.getB().getC().doSomething()`
- Methods that access objects through multiple levels of indirection

**Recommendations**:
- Follow the Law of Demeter: only talk to your immediate friends
- Use delegation to hide implementation details
- Create wrapper methods that encapsulate chains of method calls
- Apply the "Tell, Don't Ask" principle to reduce method chains

### 7. Service Classes Depending on Concrete Implementations

**Issue**: Some service classes depend on concrete implementations instead of interfaces, making testing harder.

**Recommendations**:
- Depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Use dependency injection to provide implementations
- Apply the Dependency Inversion Principle
- Create interfaces for all repositories and services

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Fixes**: Start with the most critical issues, such as cyclic dependencies and god classes
2. **Refactor Incrementally**: Make small, focused changes and run tests after each change
3. **Update Architecture Tests**: Adjust thresholds and rules as the codebase improves
4. **Document Architectural Decisions**: Record why certain patterns are used and how they should be maintained
5. **Establish Code Review Guidelines**: Ensure new code follows architectural principles

By addressing these antipatterns, the codebase will become more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand.
