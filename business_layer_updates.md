# Business Layer Updates

## Overview

This document outlines the updates made to the business layer components as part of the architecture overhaul. The goal is to ensure that the module package doesn't depend on other layers and follows the three-layer architecture (GUI, DAL, BLL + BE).

## Changes Made

### MASTER_TASK_LIST.md Updates

The MASTER_TASK_LIST.md file has been updated to reflect the actual state of the project. The following sections have been updated:

1. **Update Existing Business Entities**
   - Marked OrderBusiness.java as already extending BusinessObject
   - Marked UserBusiness.java as already extending BusinessObject
   - Marked CustomerBusiness.java as already extending BusinessObject
   - Marked ReportBusiness.java as already extending BusinessObject

2. **Update Existing Business Components**
   - Marked Photo.java as already implementing DataObject (with a note that it's a value object, not a business component)
   - Added and marked PhotoDocument.java as already extending BusinessComponent
   - Marked other business components as already updated

3. **Update Existing Data Objects**
   - Marked EmailAddress.java as already implementing DataObject
   - Marked Money.java as already implementing DataObject
   - Marked PersonName.java as already implementing DataObject
   - Marked PhoneNumber.java as already implementing DataObject
   - Marked Timestamp.java as already implementing DataObject
   - Marked other data objects as already updated

### Current State of Business Layer Components

After examining the business layer components, I found that most of them have already been updated to use the new business terminology:

1. **Business Objects**
   - OrderBusiness.java already extends BusinessObject<OrderId>
   - UserBusiness.java already extends BusinessObject<UserId>
   - CustomerBusiness.java already extends BusinessObject<CustomerId>
   - ReportBusiness.java already extends BusinessObject<ReportId>

2. **Business Components**
   - PhotoDocument.java already extends BusinessComponent<PhotoId>

3. **Data Objects**
   - Photo.java is a record that implements DataObject
   - EmailAddress.java is a record that implements DataObject
   - Money.java already implements DataObject
   - PersonName.java is a record that implements DataObject
   - PhoneNumber.java is a record that implements DataObject
   - Timestamp.java is a record that implements DataObject

4. **Business Services**
   - PhotoApprovalService.java already extends BusinessService
   - PhotoValidationService.java has been updated to extend BusinessService
   - PhotoReportGenerationService.java already extends BusinessService
   - OrderBusinessService.java has been created to replace OrderDomainService.java

5. **Exceptions**
   - AccessDeniedException.java has been updated to extend BusinessException
   - BusinessRuleViolationException.java has been updated to extend BusinessException
   - EntityNotFoundException.java has been updated to extend BusinessException
   - InvalidValueException.java has been updated to extend BusinessException
