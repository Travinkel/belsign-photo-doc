# Architecture Refactoring Summary

## Accomplished

1. **Updated Architecture Tests**:
   - Modified `CleanArchitectureLayerTest` to reference the "usecase" package instead of "application"
   - Updated layer dependency rules to reflect the current package structure
   - Fixed duplicate method in `DddConceptsTest`
   - Updated documentation comments to reflect the current architecture

2. **Verified Test Passing**:
   - All tests in `CleanArchitectureLayerTest` now pass successfully

3. **Created Comprehensive Recommendations**:
   - Documented current architecture and identified issues
   - Provided detailed recommendations for refactoring each layer
   - Included code examples to illustrate the recommended changes
   - Outlined an implementation strategy

## Remaining Work

1. **Actual Refactoring of the Codebase**:
   - The architecture tests `LayerDependencyTest` still fail due to actual architectural violations in the codebase
   - These violations need to be addressed through the refactoring recommendations documented in `CLEAN_ARCHITECTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`

2. **Specific Refactoring Tasks**:
   - **Usecase Layer**:
     - Move UI-related commands to the presentation layer
     - Create interfaces for infrastructure services
     - Use dependency injection for better testability

   - **Domain Layer**:
     - Remove dependencies on external libraries
     - Define interfaces in the domain layer for external services

   - **Infrastructure Layer**:
     - Remove dependencies on the presentation layer
     - Implement interfaces defined in the domain or usecase layer

   - **Test Classes**:
     - Create test doubles to avoid violating layer boundaries
     - Organize tests in appropriate subpackages

3. **Update Other Architecture Tests**:
   - Once the refactoring is complete, update other architecture tests to reflect the improved architecture
   - Ensure all tests pass with the refactored codebase

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Refactoring Tasks**:
   - Start with the domain layer to ensure it's completely independent
   - Then refactor the usecase layer to remove dependencies on presentation and infrastructure
   - Finally, refactor the infrastructure layer to remove dependencies on presentation

2. **Implement Changes Incrementally**:
   - Make small, focused changes
   - Run tests after each change to ensure nothing breaks
   - Commit changes frequently

3. **Update Documentation**:
   - Keep architecture documentation up-to-date as changes are made
   - Document design decisions and rationale

4. **Review and Refine**:
   - Regularly review the architecture to identify further improvements
   - Refine the architecture based on feedback and lessons learned

By following these steps, the codebase will gradually align better with Clean Architecture and DDD principles, resulting in a more maintainable, testable, and flexible application.
