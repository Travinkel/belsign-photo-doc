# Task List for BelSign Photo Documentation Module

## Overview
This task list outlines the implementation plan for Epic 1 (Authentication and User Management) and Epic 2 (Order Management) of the BelSign Photo Documentation Module. The tasks are organized by priority and dependencies to guide the development process.

## Current Status
All users (admin, qa_worker, production_worker) now have access to the main view. The authentication system is in place, but role-based access control needs to be implemented to restrict access to specific views based on user roles.

   - Implement duplicate order number detection
   - Estimated effort: 8 points

2. **Order Search and Filtering**
   - Create order search interface
   - Implement filtering by order number, date, and status
   - Add sorting capabilities
   - Optimize for performance with large datasets
   - Estimated effort: 5 points

3. **Order Details View**
   - Design and implement order details page
   - Show associated photos and their status
   - Display order metadata
   - Add responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Estimated effort: 5 points

4. **Order-Photo Association**
   - Implement functionality to associate photos with orders
   - Allow batch association of multiple photos
   - Add validation to ensure proper association
   - Estimated effort: 5 points

### Medium Priority Tasks

   - Estimated effort: 5 points

## Implementation Plan

### Sprint 1: Authentication Enhancements
- Implement Role-Based Access Control
- Enhance Login System
- Begin User Account Management UI

### Sprint 2: User Management Completion
- Complete User Account Management UI
- Implement Password Management
- Begin Order Creation Interface

### Sprint 3: Order Management Basics
- Complete Order Creation Interface
- Implement Order Search and Filtering
- Begin Order Details View

### Sprint 4: Order Management Completion
- Complete Order Details View
- Implement Order-Photo Association
- Begin Order Status Tracking

## Dependencies

1. Role-Based Access Control must be implemented before role-specific views can be restricted
2. User Account Management requires Role-Based Access Control to be in place
3. Order-Photo Association depends on both Order Creation and Photo Upload functionality
4. Order Status Tracking depends on Order Details View implementation

## Testing Strategy

1. Unit tests for all service methods
2. Integration tests for repository implementations
3. UI tests for critical user flows
4. End-to-end tests for complete user journeys
5. Performance tests for search and filtering functionality

## Conclusion

This task list provides a structured approach to implementing Epic 1 and Epic 2 of the BelSign Photo Documentation Module. By following this plan, the development team can ensure that all requirements are met and that the system provides a seamless experience for all user roles.
