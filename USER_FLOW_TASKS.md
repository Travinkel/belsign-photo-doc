## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Mobile-First Design**: All user interfaces should be designed with mobile devices in mind, especially for Production Workers who will primarily use tablets.

2. **Offline Capability**: Consider implementing offline capabilities for the Photo Capture Flow, allowing Production Workers to take photos even without network connectivity and upload them later.

3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize image handling to ensure smooth performance even with large numbers of high-resolution photos.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling throughout all flows, with clear user feedback and recovery options.

5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all interfaces are accessible, with appropriate contrast, text sizes, and touch targets.

6. **Security**: Implement proper authentication, authorization, and data protection measures throughout all flows.
