# Implementation Summary

## What Has Been Done

I have implemented the core components of the revised architecture, focusing on removing Domain-Driven Design (DDD) terminology while maintaining the core architectural principles. The following components have been created:

### Audit System (formerly Domain Events)
- Created `AuditEvent.java` interface to replace `DomainEvent.java`
- Created `BaseAuditEvent.java` abstract class to replace `AbstractDomainEvent.java`
- Created `IAuditPublisher.java` interface to replace `IDomainEventPublisher.java`
- Created `AuditHandler.java` interface to replace `DomainEventHandler.java`
- Created `AuditHandlerImplementation.java` class to replace `DomainEventHandlerImplementation.java`
- Created `AuditPublisher.java` class to replace `DomainEventPublisher.java`

### Core Business Layer Components
- Created `BusinessObject.java` class to replace `AggregateRoot.java` and `Aggregate.java`
- Created `BusinessComponent.java` class to replace `Entity.java`
- Created `IBusinessService.java` interface to replace `IDomainService.java`
- Created `BusinessService.java` abstract class to replace `DomainService.java`
- Created `DataAccessInterface.java` interface to replace `Repository.java`

### Data Objects (formerly Value Objects)
- Created `DataObject.java` interface to replace `ValueObject.java`

### Exceptions
- Created `BusinessException.java` abstract class to replace `DomainException.java`

### Task Lists
- Created comprehensive task lists for implementing the business layer, data layer, presentation layer, and architecture guide updates
- Created a master task list that combines all the individual task lists

## What Needs to Be Done Next

The next steps in the implementation process are:

1. **Update Existing Business Entities**
   - Rename and update `OrderAggregate.java` to `OrderBusiness.java` using `BusinessObject`
   - Rename and update `UserAggregate.java` to `UserBusiness.java` using `BusinessObject`
   - Rename and update `CustomerAggregate.java` to `CustomerBusiness.java` using `BusinessObject`
   - Rename and update `ReportAggregate.java` to `ReportBusiness.java` using `BusinessObject`

2. **Update Existing Business Components**
   - Update `Photo.java` to use `BusinessComponent`
   - Update other business components to use `BusinessComponent`

3. **Update Existing Data Objects**
   - Update `EmailAddress.java`, `Money.java`, `PersonName.java`, `PhoneNumber.java`, `Timestamp.java`, etc. to use `DataObject`

4. **Update Existing Business Services**
   - Update `PhotoApprovalService.java`, `PhotoValidationService.java`, `PhotoReportGenerationService.java`, etc. to use `BusinessService`

5. **Update Existing Data Access Interfaces**
   - Rename and update repository interfaces to use `DataAccessInterface`

6. **Update Existing Exceptions**
   - Update exception classes to extend `BusinessException`

7. **Update Existing Audit Events**
   - Update event classes to use `BaseAuditEvent`

8. **Update Repository and Service Implementations**
   - Update repository and service implementations to use the new interfaces and base classes

9. **Update Presentation Layer**
   - Update view models, controllers, navigation, binding, and core classes to use the new business entity naming conventions

10. **Update Architecture Guide**
    - Update the architecture guide to remove DDD terminology and use the new naming conventions

11. **Update Tests**
    - Update test classes to use the new naming conventions

## Implementation Strategy

The implementation should follow this strategy:

1. **Start with the Business Layer**
   - Update the business entities, components, data objects, services, data access interfaces, exceptions, and audit events
   - This will establish the foundation for the rest of the implementation

2. **Move to the Data Layer**
   - Update the repository implementations, service implementations, configuration, logging, and bootstrap classes
   - This will ensure that the data layer works with the updated business layer

3. **Finish with the Presentation Layer**
   - Update the view models, controllers, navigation, binding, core, and UI components
   - This will ensure that the presentation layer works with the updated business and data layers

4. **Update the Architecture Guide**
   - Update the architecture guide to reflect the new naming conventions
   - This will ensure that the documentation is consistent with the implementation

5. **Update Tests**
   - Update the tests to use the new naming conventions
   - This will ensure that the tests pass with the updated implementation

## Conclusion

The core components of the revised architecture have been implemented, and a comprehensive task list has been created to guide the rest of the implementation. The implementation follows a systematic approach, starting with the business layer, moving to the data layer, and finishing with the presentation layer. This approach ensures that the architecture is implemented consistently and that the codebase adheres to the new naming conventions.
