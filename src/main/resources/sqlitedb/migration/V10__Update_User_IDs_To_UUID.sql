-- Ensure all IDs in the database are UUIDs
-- This script is a placeholder since the new schema (V9) already uses TEXT columns for IDs
-- and the default users are added with UUIDs in V11

-- Create a function to check if a string is a valid UUID
-- This is just a simple check for the correct length and format
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS temp_functions (
    name TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    sql TEXT
);

INSERT OR REPLACE INTO temp_functions (name, sql)
VALUES ('is_uuid', 'CREATE FUNCTION is_uuid(text_to_check TEXT) 
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS 
BEGIN
    RETURN length(text_to_check) = 32 AND text_to_check GLOB ''[0-9A-Fa-f]*'';
END;');

-- Add any additional UUID validation or conversion logic here if needed

-- Note: In a real-world scenario, you might want to add code here to:
-- 1. Check if any existing IDs are not in UUID format
-- 2. Convert non-UUID IDs to UUID format
-- 3. Update foreign key references accordingly

-- For now, we're assuming all IDs will be UUIDs from this point forward
-- as enforced by application code and the V11 migration script
