# Common Domain Layer

This package contains common domain elements that are shared across multiple bounded contexts.

## Contents

- Value Objects: Immutable objects that represent domain values without identity
- Specifications: Business rules packaged as predicate objects
- Events: Domain events shared across contexts
- Exceptions: Domain exceptions that may occur across different contexts

This package aims to minimize duplication while maintaining clear boundaries between domain contexts.
