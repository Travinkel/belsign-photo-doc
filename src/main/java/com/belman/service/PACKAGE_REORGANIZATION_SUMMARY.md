# Business Layer Package Reorganization Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the work done to analyze and plan the reorganization of the business layer package structure.
The goal is to improve the organization of classes by responsibility and feature, making the codebase more maintainable
and easier to understand.

## Work Completed

1. **Analysis of Current Structure**: We analyzed the current package structure of the business layer and identified
   areas for improvement.

2. **Definition of Package Organization Rules**: We defined clear rules for organizing packages by responsibility and
   feature, as documented in [PACKAGE_STRUCTURE_GUIDELINES.md](PACKAGE_STRUCTURE_GUIDELINES.md).

3. **Creation of ArchUnit Tests**: We created ArchUnit tests to enforce the package organization rules, ensuring that
   classes are placed in the appropriate packages.

4. **Identification of Classes to Move**: We identified classes that need to be moved to different packages based on our
   organization rules, as documented in [PACKAGE_REORGANIZATION_TASKS.md](PACKAGE_REORGANIZATION_TASKS.md).

5. **Documentation**: We created comprehensive documentation explaining the package structure guidelines and the tasks
   needed to implement the reorganization.

## Key Decisions

1. **Module-Based Organization**: We decided to organize the business layer into modules, with each module representing
   a business capability or feature.

2. **Responsibility-Based Subpackages**: Within each module, we further organized classes by responsibility (e.g.,
   events, services, specifications).

3. **Feature-Based Modules**: We identified key features (order, user, customer, report, photo) and organized related
   classes into feature-specific modules.

4. **Common Utilities**: We placed common value objects and utilities in a shared module.common package.

5. **Audit Events**: We organized audit events in feature-specific events packages or in a central events package.

## Next Steps

1. **Implementation**: Follow the tasks outlined in [PACKAGE_REORGANIZATION_TASKS.md](PACKAGE_REORGANIZATION_TASKS.md)
   to implement the package reorganization.

2. **Testing**: Run the ArchUnit tests to verify that the reorganized package structure complies with our rules.

3. **Continuous Enforcement**: Integrate the ArchUnit tests into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure that the package structure
   rules are enforced going forward.

4. **Documentation Updates**: Update any documentation that references the old package structure.

5. **Developer Training**: Ensure that all developers understand the new package structure and organization rules.

## Benefits

1. **Improved Maintainability**: The reorganized package structure will make it easier to find and modify classes,
   reducing the time needed to make changes to the system.

2. **Better Testability**: The clear separation of concerns will make it easier to test individual components in
   isolation.

3. **Enhanced Readability**: The consistent package structure will make it easier for developers to understand the
   system's architecture.

4. **Reduced Coupling**: The organization by feature and responsibility will help reduce coupling between unrelated
   parts of the system.

5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers will be able to more quickly understand the system's organization and find the
   code they need to work with.

## Conclusion

The package reorganization is a significant undertaking, but it will result in a more maintainable, testable, and
understandable codebase. By following the guidelines and tasks outlined in the accompanying documents, we can
successfully implement this reorganization with minimal disruption to the development workflow.
