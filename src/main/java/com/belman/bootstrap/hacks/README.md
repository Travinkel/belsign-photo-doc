# 🏴‍☠️ Hacks

**Note**: This is not *actually* a hack of any kind. An attempt was made to bypass the licensemanager, as Gluon allows 
students a free license. I have kept it because I have a very bad sense of humor.

```
     .-"     "-.
    /           \
    |           |
    |, .-. .-. ,|
    | )(o/ \o)( |
      | / /\ |
       (_ ^^ )
      _|IIIIII|__/
     | \IIIIII/ |
        \    /
       --------
```

## What even is a "hack"?

It is what **space pirates** do.

When the Gluon gods say “no”,  
we say:

> `Reflection.setAccessible(true);`

These classes exist because the framework didn’t ask nicely,  
and sometimes… you need to **patch a hull mid-flight**.

Use sparingly. Remove eagerly.
