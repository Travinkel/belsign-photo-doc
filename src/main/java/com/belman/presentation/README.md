# Package: `com.belman.presentation`

## 1. Purpose

* The presentation package implements the user interface layer of the application using JavaFX and the MVVM+C pattern.
* It contains views, view models, and controllers that provide the visual representation of the application.
* It represents the bridge between the user and the application's business logic, handling user interactions and displaying data.

## 2. Key Classes and Interfaces

* `BaseView` - Base class for all views, extending Gluon's View class and implementing the MVVM pattern.
* `BaseViewModel` - Base class for all view models, providing observable properties and lifecycle management.
* `BaseController` - Base class for all controllers, handling user interactions and coordinating with view models.
* `ViewStackManager` - Manages the navigation stack and transitions between views.
* `ViewRegistry` - Registry of all available views in the application.
* `Router` - Handles navigation between views with support for transitions and route guards.
* `RouteGuardImpl` - Implements role-based access control for navigation.
* `ViewTransition` - Interface for view transition animations with implementations like FadeViewTransition and SlideViewTransition.

## 3. Architectural Role

* This package is the presentation layer in the clean architecture.
* It implements the MVVM+C (Model-View-ViewModel + Controller) pattern for UI organization.
* It depends on the application layer for business logic but is independent of the infrastructure layer.
* It provides a responsive and touch-friendly user interface for both desktop and mobile platforms.

## 4. Requirements Coverage

* Implements user interfaces for authentication (login, logout).
* Provides dashboards for different user roles (admin, worker, QA).
* Supports photo capture and documentation workflows.
* Enables order management and tracking.
* Implements quality assurance review interfaces.
* Provides reporting and export functionality.
* Supports responsive design for different screen sizes.
* Implements touch-friendly interfaces for mobile devices.

## 5. Usage and Flow

* The presentation layer follows the MVVM+C pattern:
  1. Views (BaseView subclasses) define the UI structure and appearance
  2. ViewModels (BaseViewModel subclasses) provide observable properties and presentation logic
  3. Controllers (BaseController subclasses) handle user interactions and coordinate with ViewModels
  4. The application layer is called to execute business operations
* Navigation flow:
  1. User triggers a navigation action (button click, menu selection)
  2. Router checks access permissions through RouteGuard
  3. ViewStackManager transitions to the new view with animations
  4. View lifecycle methods are called (onViewShown, onViewHidden)
* Data binding connects UI components to ViewModel properties for automatic updates.

## 6. Patterns and Design Decisions

* **MVVM+C Pattern**: Separates UI (View), presentation logic (ViewModel), and interaction handling (Controller).
* **Command Pattern**: Used for encapsulating user actions and navigation.
* **Factory Pattern**: ViewFactory creates views and their dependencies.
* **Dependency Injection**: Used to provide services to ViewModels and Controllers.
* **Observer Pattern**: JavaFX properties and bindings for reactive UI updates.
* **State Pattern**: Used for managing view state and transitions.
* **Strategy Pattern**: Different view transitions (fade, slide) can be swapped.
* **Lifecycle Management**: Structured lifecycle for views and view models.

## 7. Unnecessary Complexity

* The custom dependency injection mechanism adds complexity compared to using an established framework.
* Some views have too many responsibilities and could be split into smaller, more focused components.
* The navigation system is complex with multiple layers (Router, ViewStackManager, RouteGuard).
* Error handling is inconsistent across different views and view models.
* Some UI components are tightly coupled to specific business logic.
* The FXML loading mechanism is complex and error-prone.

## 8. Refactoring Opportunities

* Replace the custom dependency injection with a standard framework like Spring or Dagger.
* Extract reusable UI components to reduce duplication across views.
* Standardize error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
* Improve separation between presentation logic and business logic.
* Enhance the navigation system to support deep linking and back navigation history.
* Add more comprehensive unit tests for ViewModels and Controllers.
* Implement a more consistent approach to form validation.
* Improve accessibility for users with disabilities.
