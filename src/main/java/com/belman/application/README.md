# Package: `com.belman.application`

## 1. Purpose

* The application package implements the business logic layer of the application.
* It contains services and use cases that coordinate domain objects to fulfill user requests.
* It acts as a bridge between the presentation layer (UI) and the domain layer (business rules).

## 2. Key Classes and Interfaces

* `BaseService` - Abstract base class for all services with common logging and dependency injection.
* `DefaultAuthenticationService` - Handles user authentication, session management, and access control.
* `PhotoCaptureService` - Manages the capture and processing of photos.
* `OrderService` - Handles order creation, search, and status tracking.
* `QualityControlService` - Manages the approval workflow for photos.
* `ReportGenerationService` - Creates quality control reports from approved photos.
* `ValidationService` - Validates user inputs before processing.

## 3. Architectural Role

* This package is the business logic layer in the 3-layer architecture.
* It sits between the presentation layer (UI) and the data access layer (repositories).
* It implements use cases that fulfill the application's requirements.
* It depends on the domain layer but is independent of the presentation and data access layers.

## 4. Requirements Coverage

* Implements authentication and user management (FR4.1-4.5)
* Handles order management and tracking (FR1.1-1.4)
* Manages photo capture, metadata, and approval (FR2.1-2.5)
* Supports quality control report generation (FR3.1-3.3)
* Enables offline operation and synchronization (NFR5.1-5.2)
* Provides error handling and validation (NFR4.1-4.3)

## 5. Usage and Flow

* Typical flow:
  1. User interacts with the UI (presentation layer)
  2. UI calls a service in the application layer
  3. Service validates inputs and applies business rules
  4. Service uses domain objects to perform operations
  5. Service uses repositories to persist changes
  6. Service returns results to the UI

## 6. Patterns and Design Decisions

* **Service Pattern**: Each service encapsulates a specific set of related use cases.
* **Dependency Injection**: Services receive their dependencies through constructors.
* **Validation**: Input validation is performed before business logic execution.
* **Transaction Management**: Services ensure data consistency during operations.
* **Error Handling**: Standardized approach to error reporting and recovery.

## 7. Unnecessary Complexity

* Some services have too many responsibilities and could be split into smaller, more focused services.
* The dependency on ServiceLocator creates hidden dependencies and makes testing harder.
* There's duplication in error handling and validation logic across different services.
* Some services contain presentation logic that should be in the presentation layer.

## 8. Refactoring Opportunities

* Replace ServiceLocator with constructor-based dependency injection.
* Create smaller, more focused services with single responsibilities.
* Extract common validation logic into reusable validators.
* Move any presentation logic to the presentation layer.
* Standardize error handling across all services.
* Add more comprehensive unit tests for services.
