# Shared Package

This package contains shared code that is used across multiple components in the domain layer. It is part of the domain
layer, not a separate layer.

Shared code includes:

- Domain events
- Value objects
- Entities
- Aggregates
- Domain services

- Specifications

All shared domain code should be placed in this package, not in a separate shared layer.
