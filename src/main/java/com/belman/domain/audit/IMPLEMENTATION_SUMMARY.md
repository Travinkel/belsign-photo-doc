# Audit System Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of the audit system in the business layer. The audit system replaces the
previous domain event system with a more business-oriented approach that focuses on auditing.

## Changes Made

1. **Created new audit event classes**:
    - `AuditEvent` interface in `business.module.audit.event`
    - `BaseAuditEvent` abstract class in `business.module.audit.event`
    - `IAuditPublisher` interface in `business.module.audit.event`
    - `AuditHandler` interface in `business.module.audit.event`
    - `AuditHandlerImplementation` class in `business.module.audit.event`
    - `AuditPublisher` class in `business.module.audit.event`

2. **Created user-specific audit events**:
    - `UserApprovedAuditEvent` in `business.module.user.events`
    - `UserRejectedAuditEvent` in `business.module.user.events`
    - `UserLoggedInAuditEvent` in `business.module.user.events`
    - `UserLoggedOutAuditEvent` in `business.module.user.events`

3. **Updated imports in affected files**:
    - `AuditFacade.java`
    - `AuditRepository.java`
    - `DefaultAuditFacade.java`
    - `BusinessObject.java`
    - `BusinessService.java`
    - `OrderBusiness.java`
    - `UserBusiness.java`
    - `InMemoryAuditRepository.java`
    - `DefaultAuditFacadeTest.java`
    - `BusinessObjectTest.java`

4. **Fixed method calls in `UserBusiness.java`**:
    - Updated `approve()` method to use `UserApprovedAuditEvent`
    - Updated `reject()` method to use `UserApprovedAuditEvent`
    - Removed methods that were using non-existent methods from `BusinessObject`

## Issues Encountered

1. **Parallel Class Hierarchies**:
    - We have two parallel class hierarchies: DDD-style (`AggregateRoot` -> `UserAggregate`) and Business-style (
      `BusinessObject` -> `UserBusiness`)
    - This causes compatibility issues, especially with interfaces like `ApprovalState` that are designed to work with
      one hierarchy but are used by both

2. **Incompatible Event Types**:
    - `UserAggregate` registers `UserApprovedEvent` as a `DomainEvent`, but they're not compatible with the new event
      system
    - `OrderAggregate` registers various order events as `DomainEvent`, but they're not compatible with the new event
      system

3. **Method Signature Mismatches**:
    - `ApprovalState` methods expect `UserBusiness`, but `UserAggregate` passes itself

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the migration to the audit system**:
    - Update all remaining files to use the new audit event classes
    - Remove the old domain event classes once they're no longer used

2. **Address the parallel class hierarchies**:
    - Follow the medium-term solution outlined in `REFACTORING_NOTES.md`
    - Convert one aggregate at a time to use the business object hierarchy
    - Update all references to use the new classes
    - Remove the old classes once all references are updated

3. **Run tests to ensure everything still works**:
    - Fix any remaining issues
    - Ensure all tests pass

## Conclusion

The implementation of the audit system is a significant step towards moving away from DDD terminology and adopting a
more business-oriented approach. However, there are still issues to be addressed, particularly with the parallel class
hierarchies. The next steps outlined above will help complete the migration and ensure a consistent approach throughout
the codebase.
