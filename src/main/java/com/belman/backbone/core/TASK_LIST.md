# Task List for Backbone Framework Improvements

## 1. Command Pattern for UI Actions

The Command pattern encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of operations. Implementing this pattern will improve the backbone framework by:

- Decoupling UI components from the actions they trigger
- Enabling undo/redo functionality
- Supporting command queuing and batching
- Facilitating logging and auditing of user actions

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Create Command Interface**
   - Define a base `Command` interface with `execute()` and `undo()` methods
   - Add support for command parameters and result handling

2. **Implement Command Manager**
   - Create a `CommandManager` class to track command history
   - Add methods for executing commands and managing the command stack
   - Implement undo/redo functionality

3. **Create Common UI Commands**
   - Implement standard commands for common UI actions:
     - `NavigateCommand` for view navigation
     - `SaveDataCommand` for data persistence
     - `LoadDataCommand` for data retrieval
     - `ValidationCommand` for input validation

4. **Add Command Binding Support**
   - Extend the existing view binding mechanism to support command binding
   - Create utilities for binding commands to UI controls (buttons, menu items, etc.)
   - Support automatic enabling/disabling of UI elements based on command state

5. **Implement Composite Commands**
   - Create a `CompositeCommand` class for executing multiple commands as a unit
   - Support transaction-like behavior with rollback on failure

## 2. Gluon Mobile-specific View Transitions

Enhancing the framework with mobile-friendly view transitions will improve the user experience on mobile devices and provide a more native feel to the application.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Create Transition Interface**
   - Define a `ViewTransition` interface for encapsulating transition animations
   - Support different transition types (fade, slide, etc.)
   - Ensure compatibility with both JavaFX and Gluon Mobile

2. **Implement Common Transitions**
   - Create standard transitions:
     - `FadeTransition` for fading views in/out
     - `SlideTransition` for sliding views in from different directions
     - `FlipTransition` for 3D flip effects
     - `ZoomTransition` for zooming views in/out

3. **Enhance Router with Transition Support**
   - Modify the existing router to support transitions between views
   - Add methods for specifying transitions when navigating
   - Implement default transitions based on navigation direction (forward/backward)

4. **Add Platform-specific Optimizations**
   - Detect platform (desktop/mobile) and optimize transitions accordingly
   - Use hardware acceleration when available
   - Adjust animation durations based on platform guidelines

5. **Create Transition Presets**
   - Define common transition combinations for different scenarios
   - Support iOS and Android-specific transition styles
   - Allow easy customization of transition parameters

## 3. Rich Object Model for Core API

Enhance the Core API with a richer object model to improve type safety, discoverability, and maintainability.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Expand Type-safe State Management**
   - Create predefined state keys for common application state
   - Add support for complex state objects with nested properties
   - Implement state validation and schema definition

2. **Enhance Event System**
   - Add support for event prioritization
   - Implement event filtering and transformation
   - Create utilities for common event patterns (throttling, debouncing)

3. **Improve Dependency Injection**
   - Add support for scoped services (singleton, transient, scoped)
   - Implement lazy initialization for services
   - Add service lifecycle hooks (init, destroy)

4. **Create UI Component Library**
   - Develop reusable UI components optimized for both desktop and mobile
   - Implement responsive layout containers
   - Create mobile-friendly input controls (touch-optimized)

5. **Add Validation Framework**
   - Implement declarative validation rules
   - Support cross-field validation
   - Add real-time validation feedback

## 4. Performance Optimizations

Improve the performance of the backbone framework, especially for mobile devices with limited resources.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Implement View Recycling**
   - Create a view cache to reuse view instances
   - Add support for view pooling for frequently used views
   - Implement memory management for unused views

2. **Optimize State Management**
   - Add support for partial state updates
   - Implement efficient state diffing
   - Add state compression for large state objects

3. **Enhance Asynchronous Operations**
   - Improve the task scheduling system
   - Add support for prioritized background tasks
   - Implement cancellation and timeout handling

4. **Add Resource Management**
   - Create utilities for managing images and other resources
   - Implement automatic resource cleanup
   - Add support for resource caching

5. **Optimize Startup Time**
   - Implement lazy loading for views and services
   - Add support for progressive initialization
   - Create a splash screen framework for showing loading progress

## 5. Testing and Documentation

Improve the testability and documentation of the backbone framework.

### Implementation Tasks

1. **Enhance Testing Support**
   - Create test utilities for UI testing
   - Add support for mocking services and dependencies
   - Implement test fixtures for common scenarios

2. **Improve Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive API documentation
   - Add usage examples for common patterns
   - Create tutorials for new developers

3. **Add Diagnostics**
   - Implement logging and tracing
   - Add performance monitoring
   - Create debugging tools for development

4. **Create Sample Applications**
   - Develop sample applications showcasing framework features
   - Create templates for common application types
   - Add code snippets for common tasks

5. **Add Migration Guides**
   - Document breaking changes between versions
   - Create utilities for migrating from older versions
   - Provide compatibility layers for backward compatibility
