# Package: `com.belman.common`

## 1. Purpose

* The common package provides cross-cutting utilities and services used throughout the application.
* It contains reusable components that don't belong to a specific domain or layer.
* It represents the shared infrastructure that supports the application's core functionality.

## 2. Key Classes and Interfaces

* `PlatformUtils` - Utility class for platform detection (Android, iOS, desktop).
* `EmojiLogger` - Enhanced logging utility that adds emoticons to log messages for better readability.
* `AuthLoggingService` - Specialized logging service for authentication-related events.
* `SessionContext` - Interface for managing user session state across the application.
* `SimpleSessionContext` - Implementation of SessionContext that tracks the current user and session state.
* `Inject` - Annotation used for dependency injection throughout the application.
* `SecureConfigStorage` - Utility for securely storing and retrieving configuration values.

## 3. Architectural Role

* This package is part of the infrastructure layer, providing technical services to all other layers.
* It contains cross-cutting concerns that span multiple layers of the application.
* It provides abstractions for platform-specific functionality, allowing the core application to remain platform-agnostic.
* It implements technical services like logging, configuration, and session management that support the business logic.

## 4. Requirements Coverage

* Supports cross-platform functionality through platform detection utilities.
* Enhances application observability through comprehensive logging utilities.
* Provides secure configuration storage for sensitive application settings.
* Enables session management for tracking user state and authentication.
* Facilitates dependency injection for loose coupling between components.
* Implements naming conventions for consistent code organization.

## 5. Usage and Flow

* The common package is used by all other packages in the application.
* Typical usage patterns include:
  1. Logging events and errors using EmojiLogger
  2. Checking platform type with PlatformUtils to enable platform-specific behavior
  3. Managing user sessions through SessionContext
  4. Injecting dependencies using the Inject annotation
  5. Storing and retrieving configuration values securely
* These utilities are typically instantiated early in the application lifecycle and used throughout the application's execution.

## 6. Patterns and Design Decisions

* **Singleton Pattern**: Used in classes like EmojiLoggerFactory to provide a single instance of a service.
* **Adapter Pattern**: EmojiLoggerAdapter adapts the domain Logger interface to the common logging implementation.
* **Facade Pattern**: AuthLoggingService provides a simplified interface for authentication-related logging.
* **Decorator Pattern**: EmojiLogger decorates the standard SLF4J Logger with additional functionality.
* **Dependency Injection**: The Inject annotation supports a custom dependency injection mechanism.
* **Platform Abstraction**: PlatformUtils abstracts platform-specific details to enable cross-platform code.

## 7. Unnecessary Complexity

* The custom dependency injection mechanism (Inject annotation and related classes) duplicates functionality that could be provided by established frameworks like Spring or Dagger.
* Multiple logging abstractions (EmojiLogger, Logger, AuthLoggingService) create confusion about which logging mechanism to use in different contexts.
* The platform detection in PlatformUtils is simplistic and might not handle all edge cases correctly.
* Some utility classes have too many responsibilities and could be split into more focused classes.

## 8. Refactoring Opportunities

* Replace the custom dependency injection with a standard framework like Spring or Dagger.
* Consolidate logging abstractions into a single, comprehensive logging facade.
* Improve platform detection with more robust checks and better abstraction of platform-specific behavior.
* Extract specialized functionality from utility classes into dedicated, focused classes.
* Add more comprehensive unit tests for utility classes.
* Consider using more modern Java features like Optional, Stream API, and functional interfaces where appropriate.
