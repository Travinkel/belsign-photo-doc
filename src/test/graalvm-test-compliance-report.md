# GraalVM + Gluon Substrate Test Compliance Report

## Overview
This reportAggregate analyzes the compatibility of the Backbone framework's test suite with GraalVM native image and Gluon Substrate for mobile deployment.

## Test Files Analysis

### Unit Tests

#### SmtpEmailServiceTest.java
- **Status**: ⚠️ Needs GraalVM config
- **Issues**:
  - Uses `java.io.File` with hardcoded file paths which assumes a desktop file system
  - Creates a file reference to "test-reportAggregate.pdf" which may not exist on mobile platforms
- **Recommendation**: 
  - Use platform-agnostic file access through Gluon's storage APIs
  - Consider mocking file system operations for tests

### Integration Tests
No active integration tests were found in the codebase. The integration test directory structure exists but contains no test classes.

## Test Resources Analysis

### FXML Files
- **DummyView.fxml** (in dummy resources)
  - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs GraalVM config
  - **Issues**:
    - References a controller class `unit.athomefx.dummy.DummyController` that doesn't exist in the codebase
    - FXML loading requires reflection which needs GraalVM configuration
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Add reflect-config.json entries for FXML components
    - Add resource-config.json to include FXML files in native image

- **DummyView.fxml** (in integration/athomefx/dummy resources)
  - **Status**: ⚠️ Needs GraalVM config
  - **Issues**:
    - References a controller class `com.belman.integration.dummy.DummyController` that doesn't exist in the codebase
    - FXML loading requires reflection which needs GraalVM configuration
  - **Recommendation**:
    - Add reflect-config.json entries for FXML components
    - Add resource-config.json to include FXML files in native image

## Missing GraalVM Configuration

The project lacks essential GraalVM configuration files:
- **reflect-config.json**: Required for classes that use reflection
- **resource-config.json**: Required for resources that need to be included in the native image

These configurations are necessary for:
1. FXML loading and processing
2. Controller class instantiation
3. Resource loading

## Summary of Test Compatibility

### ✅ Fully Portable Tests
- None identified (all tests require some GraalVM configuration)

### ⚠️ Tests that Need GraalVM Config
- **SmtpEmailServiceTest.java**: Needs configuration for file system access
- **FXML resources**: Need reflection and resource configuration

### ❌ Tests that Cannot Run on Mobile
- None identified (all tests can potentially run with proper configuration)

## Recommendations

1. **Create GraalVM Configuration Files**:
   - Add reflect-config.json for reflection used in FXML loading
   - Add resource-config.json for FXML and other resources

2. **Update File System Access**:
   - Replace direct java.io.File usage with Gluon's storage APIs
   - Use relative paths and resource loading instead of absolute file paths

3. **Implement Missing Controller Classes**:
   - Create the controller classes referenced in FXML files or update the FXML files

4. **Add Integration Tests**:
   - Implement integration tests for the Backbone framework
   - Ensure they use mobile-compatible APIs

5. **Test on Mobile Devices**:
   - Verify tests run correctly on Android and iOS simulators
   - Address any platform-specific issues

By implementing these recommendations, the Backbone framework's test suite will be fully compatible with GraalVM native image and Gluon Substrate for mobile deployment.
