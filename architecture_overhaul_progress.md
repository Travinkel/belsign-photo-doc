# Architecture Overhaul Progress

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made in the architecture overhaul and outlines the next steps. The goal of the overhaul is to ensure that the module package doesn't depend on other layers and follows the three-layer architecture (GUI, DAL, BLL + BE).

## Progress Made

### Business Layer Implementation

1. **Core Business Layer Components**
   - Created base classes for business objects, components, services, and exceptions
   - Updated existing business entities to use BusinessObject
   - Updated existing business components to use BusinessComponent
   - Updated existing data objects to use DataObject
   - Updated existing business services to use BusinessService
   - Updated existing exceptions to extend BusinessException

2. **Audit Events**
   - Updated order events to use BaseAuditEvent
   - Updated photo events to use BaseAuditEvent
   - Updated user events to use BaseAuditEvent
   - Updated report events to use BaseAuditEvent
   - Created a standardization plan for audit events (audit_events_standardization_plan.md)

3. **Data Access**
   - Created UserDataAccess interface
   - Created UserDataAccessAdapter class
   - Updated ApplicationInitializer to use the adapter

### Architecture Guide Update

1. **Terminology**
   - Replaced "Domain Layer" with "Business Layer"
   - Replaced "Aggregates" with "Business Objects"
   - Replaced "Entities" with "Business Components"
   - Replaced "Value Objects" with "Data Objects"
   - Replaced "Domain Events" with "Audit Events"
   - Replaced "Repositories" with "Data Access Interfaces"
   - Replaced "Domain Services" with "Business Services"
   - Replaced "Domain Exceptions" with "Business Exceptions"
   - Replaced "Aggregate Root" with "Primary Business Object"
   - Replaced "Domain Logic" with "Business Logic"
   - Replaced "Domain Objects" with "Business Objects"

2. **Layer Responsibilities**
   - Updated Business Layer responsibilities
   - Updated Infrastructure Layer responsibilities

3. **Communication Between Layers**
   - Updated communication between layers

4. **Boundary Rules**
   - Updated boundary rules

5. **Architecture Enforcement**
   - Updated architecture enforcement
   - Implemented data access adapters for module layer independence

## Next Steps

### Update UserAggregate to UserBusiness

1. **Update RBAC Classes**
   - Update RoleBasedAccessController.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate
   - Update AccessPolicy.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate
   - Update RoleBasedAccessManager.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate

2. **Update PhotoDocument Class**
   - Update PhotoDocument.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate

3. **Update Event Classes**
   - Update UserLoggedInEvent.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate
   - Update UserLoggedOutEvent.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate

4. **Update Services**
   - Update SessionManager.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate
   - Update ServiceInjector.java to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate

5. **Update View Models and Controllers**
   - Update view models to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate
   - Update controllers to use UserBusiness instead of UserAggregate

### Audit Events Standardization

1. **Consolidate BaseAuditEvent Classes**
   - Keep com.belman.domain.audit.event.BaseAuditEvent
   - Remove com.belman.domain.events.BaseAuditEvent

2. **Standardize Event Approach**
   - Update all event classes to use com.belman.domain.audit.event.BaseAuditEvent

3. **Remove Duplicate Events**
   - Keep the "Audit" versions of events
   - Remove the non-Audit versions

4. **Update References**
   - Update all references to the removed events to use the kept events

### Data Layer Implementation

1. **Repository Implementations**
   - Update repository implementations to use DataAccessInterface

2. **Service Implementations**
   - Update service implementations to use BusinessService

3. **Configuration**
   - Update configuration classes to use the new naming conventions

4. **Bootstrap**
   - Update bootstrap classes to use the new naming conventions

### Presentation Layer Implementation

1. **View Models**
   - Update view models to use the new business entity naming conventions

2. **Controllers**
   - Update controllers to use the new business entity naming conventions

3. **Navigation**
   - Update navigation-related classes to use the new business entity naming conventions

4. **Binding**
   - Update binding-related classes to use the new business entity naming conventions

5. **Core**
   - Update core classes to use the new business entity naming conventions

### Testing

1. **Business Layer Tests**
   - Update tests to use the new naming conventions

2. **Data Layer Tests**
   - Update tests to use the new naming conventions

3. **Presentation Layer Tests**
   - Update tests to use the new naming conventions

## Conclusion

Significant progress has been made in the architecture overhaul, particularly in the business layer implementation and architecture guide update. The next steps focus on standardizing audit events, implementing the data layer, and updating the presentation layer to use the new naming conventions. By following this plan, we can ensure that the module package doesn't depend on other layers and follows the three-layer architecture.
