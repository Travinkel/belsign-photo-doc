# ArchUnit Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of ArchUnit in the BelSign Photo Documentation Module project. ArchUnit is a Java library for testing the architecture of your Java code, allowing you to check if your code adheres to architectural rules and constraints.

## Changes Made

1. Added ArchUnit dependency to `pom.xml`:
   ```xml
   <!-- ArchUnit for architecture testing -->
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.tngtech.archunit</groupId>
       <artifactId>archunit-junit5</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.1</version>
       <scope>test</scope>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Created architecture test classes in `src/test/java/com/belman/architecture/`:
   - `LayerDependencyTest.java`: Enforces clean architecture layer dependencies
   - `PackageDependencyTest.java`: Enforces specific package dependencies
   - `NamingConventionTest.java`: Enforces naming conventions

3. Created a README.md file in the architecture test package to document the tests and how to use them.

## Test Results

Running the architecture tests revealed several violations of clean architecture principles in the current codebase:

### Layer Dependency Violations

- Domain layer depends on presentation and infrastructure layers
- Application layer depends on presentation layer
- Infrastructure layer depends on presentation layer

These violations go against clean architecture principles where dependencies should only point inward (towards the domain layer).

### Package Dependency Violations

- Some controllers are not in the presentation layer (e.g., RoleBasedAccessController)
- Some service implementations are not in the application or infrastructure layers
- Some service interfaces are not in the domain layer
- Some view models are not in the presentation layer (e.g., QCReportViewModel)

### Naming Convention Violations

- The Inject interface starts with "I", which violates the naming convention that interfaces should not have an "I" prefix

## Benefits of ArchUnit

1. **Automated Architecture Verification**: ArchUnit allows you to automatically verify that your code adheres to your architectural rules.

2. **Early Detection of Violations**: Architecture violations are detected early in the development process, making them easier to fix.

3. **Documentation as Code**: Architectural rules are expressed as code, making them executable and always up-to-date.

4. **Improved Code Quality**: Enforcing architectural rules leads to better code organization and maintainability.

5. **Easier Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand the architectural rules by looking at the ArchUnit tests.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Violations**: Address the architectural violations identified by the ArchUnit tests.

2. **Add More Tests**: Add more specific architectural tests to enforce additional rules.

3. **Integrate with CI/CD**: Run ArchUnit tests as part of the continuous integration pipeline.

4. **Refine Rules**: Refine the architectural rules based on project needs and feedback.

## Conclusion

ArchUnit has been successfully installed and used to test the architecture of the BelSign Photo Documentation Module. The tests have revealed several architectural violations that should be addressed to improve the codebase's adherence to clean architecture principles.
